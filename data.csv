As we all know that how the male dominating society have suppressed them once. When they were not give the equal opportunities to grow as males, to study to become a scholar instead of being a house wife. But in the past few years the society have changed so much that the country started talking about the equality among all the genders. People are talking about the women empowerment and government is doing a lot of efforts to grow women. In this scenario I don't think they should reclaim domestic activities such as cooking or gardening. These are all things that man and women both can do there shouldn't be any specificity that only this work is for women and this work is for men. If we need to maintain the equality among the country needs to give more opportunities to women to grow.",Taliban is basically a group of people who follow that old mind set of keeping women as a shoe of their leg and not to let them grow. Thay always had a thinking that men has always been dominated to the society and that's their right to be. They have always been following the way of violence as we can even see how they attacked Afghanistan by giving guns to teens youngsters. Which led to the sufferings and many crimes to the people of Afghanistan. I can not forget the day when people of Afghanistan were trying to get fitted outside of the plane and fell from a height. That can give me an overview what situations they might be facing their. And if the UN recognise the islamic states of Afghanistan then taliban will feel more empowered. That might be good for some people who a followes of taliban but a great part of the country will need to suffer too. Because the people won't be able to grow their mindset.  ,False

5,1,Devashish Verma,"Yes, feminists should reclaim domestic activities as empowering. Nowadays feminists have got a wrong idea regarding the women performing domestic chores. They think that women who are performing all these chores are facing extreme discrimination which is not always true. Performing household chores doesn't mean a woman is facing discrimination. Many women perform household chores by choice. And a woman facing discrimination is capable enough to raise her voice. Feminists haven't got the right to label household chores under the cover of discrimination. ","UN shouldn't recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. Taliban didn't fulfill any condition of the Doha agreement 2020. They had to adhere to a ceasefire with the Aghan government but it didn't happen. From the day itself when the US and allies ordered the complete withdrawal a war broke out between the Aghan forces and Taliban. As they seized the power and gained control of Afghanistan, they have been repeating what they did during late 1990s. They have banned the women from attending schools and now universities. Women have been banned to work for NGOs. They have banned the dramas featuring female actors. The women are being brutally Suppressed in Afghanistan by Taliban by snatching away the rights of women which is absolutely opposite from what they have promised. The agreement also stated that Taliban will prevent the activities that can put the security of the US and it's allies in danger. But instead of fulfilling it, Taliban was providing a safe haven to AL Zawahari an Egyptian born militant. So not recognising the islamic emirate of Afghanistan is the best decision of the UN.

5,1,Aryan Ved Dhawan ,"Feminism in 21 century is not about equality anymore but has become more radical pick n chose game for women to avoid responsibility.
Feminism's idea in its roots is beautiful and revolutionary. But saying domestic activities is not ""empowering"" is dumb.
The fact of the matter is our society works like  an integrated machine with different gears, every job is important and respected. If women come together and say we are not going to cook food or do gardening, either men will learn to do that themselves ,i myself learning how to cook or it will create job opportunities for the people with that particular skill set. 
There have been jobs that people mainly men do in the world, risking lives to feed their families like taking sulfur out of volcanoes without proper equipment, building skyscrapers, clearing sewage etc. Nobody likes these jobs but are done regardless.Most of us don't have to do that but domestic work is something you can't run from ,if a women don't want to cook well who to you expect to cook for you what about what about washing clothes . You need to keep you surroundings clean for at least you own mental health and physical health as well. Of course you don't have to do any of this if you make a good income. But if don't have money to get basic domestic activities like cooking, cleaning and washing done you are not a lazy ignorant and irresponsible person which is a liability to society. Though Indian women are smart but a few wants something completely different things under the cloak of feminism. So,be a feminist and do all the things that requires you to be great at what you do hopefully morally right things. 
Note:i used female feminist in this coz I never listened a male feminist saying any work is less empowering. So no fancy phobic words on me.",I really don't care about these things.,False
5,1,Sachin Rout ,"I am for the motion and I believe feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering. Feminism stands for the equal rights of women in each and every field. No work is small or big and what is shame in doing your own house chores. What I feel is in making of a doctor, engineer or any educated professional there is a backend role of parents not only mother who makes his/her life easy by managing all these “small” works. So, if women want their representation in workplaces, they need not leave their household chores. I think no work has a gender, to live lives peacefully we need to divide works regardless of gender. Today in this fast-pacing world, women have excelled heights breaking all the barriers and sufferings which they gone through in past. Some educated women should stop judging other women if they are doing their household chores. They should educate them and motivate them for doing things which will make them meet their own self. I feel bad when a woman who is looked upon for doing things for his husband and son in love. The world is way beyond this and for some it becomes so toxic at times they need something for their refreshment. They should not be looked upon rather we all should divide our works at home. Why only women have the responsibility of cooking and men have to do outside work? There are ample number of examples around us. We have Sanjeev Kapoor excellent chef, Vineeta Singh a rising entrepreneur and so many. At the end, I must say work has no gender.","I don’t think UN should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. It will be a black day if it happens and the world will end for humanitarian causes. How can an organization like Taliban who in first place is a terrorist organization and who has no respect for human rights, including for women, girls, and minorities can be recognized by UN? The takeover by the Taliban, followed by the disruption of international financial assistance, has left the worn-torn country in economic, humanitarian, and human rights crises. Women and girls have been deprived of their rights, including the right to education, and disappeared from the public under Taliban rule, Afghanistan's de facto authorities. The Taliban's latest ban on women prevents them from using gyms and entering parks. Thousands of women have since lost their jobs or were forced to resign from government institutions and the private sector. The day is not far when they will raise question on their existence. Additionally, the Taliban are failing in the most basic government functions. They are not even able to pay the salaries of government employees let alone offer other public services. What I feel if they will be recognized then they will cause harm to global economy also. It will be unrest across the globe dealing with such disastrous leaders of a country. Most important of all, the recognition of the Taliban would offer an attractive template for terrorist groups across the world: If they can topple their governments, they are likely to get international recognition. So I conclude by using UN should not even think twice in rejection of this futile and disastrous proposal of giving recognition to Taliban.",False
5,1,Sanya Arora ,"“An independent personality, with a repertoire of execution fields, is more prominent than a dependent and socially vulnerable burden.”
With strong field points, and inclination in the right direction, I’d like to favour the idea of “feminists actively reclaiming domestic activities as a part and parcel of empowering the domain”. Women, have faced exceptional struggles because of the hitherto ideologies in the recent  chunks of era and there’s no denying to the fact, that it has definitely had a negative and depreciating impact to the purview of their ethos and confidence as an integral part of the society. However, the feminist groups and congregation of vigilant contributors, have put their best foot forward to time and again prove and render the salubrious set of rights for women groups and regurgitation of basic virtues to empower the women in equitable sense as that of male counterparts. It makes no sense, to internalize any piece of work as a cup of tea for a male or a female. It is more about accepting any physical or mental specialisation the work requires, and acting upon it with the best effort regardless of any discrimination. While social groups initialising the rights for women, have succeeded abundantly well in executing their recruitment for the sets of rules, that enable women to exercise freedom, however, there are still a bunch of acceptances that the groups need to adopt to ensure the flexibility of exercising authority and independence. For instance, the household chores right from cooking to washing and cleaning must be reclaimed as empowering activities, regardless of gender. These activities should be actively promoted to make sure, the women attain capability and clarity of thought to handle an additional and empowering set of skills that contributes well into making them self sufficient and also eradicate their dependency on the third person, to perform any task. In my belief, a woman who’s socially active, financially independent and well versed with domestic activities to sustain herself with a gallimaufry of attributes, adds to the productivity of our nation and as a whole, serve as humongous charts of inspiration for young budding and talented women, to take steps that are socially and technically pertinent. ","There’s been a major impede and traumatic situation for the vast congregations of people comprising a set of different values and virtues, being locked between us and Mexico border. It’s almost a daunting experience to undergo a state, where the freedom and independence to perform flexibility of ideologies and actions has taken the back seat for these residents. In a way, this has contributed to despair and eradication of hope among people who not only were expecting better outcomes, but also a better execution of rescue plan in a fastidious and efficient pattern. Taking into account how negatively this situation has impacted young torchbearers of the country, there’s no denying to an exponential rise in the illegal activities and tactics. Right schemes need to be implemented as there is a dire need to promote stringency. ",False
46,0,Alok kumar meena ,"According to my point of view we can see both positive and negative aspects of this quote . Domestic activities such as gardening and cooking are common to both men and women so this is not necessary that only feminist should have to do domestic activities. So the statement ""feminist should actively reclaimed domestic activities"" is not completely appreciable. Feminist also have the right to  work equally like man for the development of the country.
But as I have already said that domestic activities suggest gardening cooking are also important in the life of everyone. So if I have the point of view  that womens should have equal rights as men i.e. working for the country, the domestic activities are also needful for feminist.

5,1,Mohan,"Since the early days, Women have been the strongest competitor when it comes to the area of household chores but nowadays feminists are classifying this area more of discriminatory rather than being proud of. Feminists should take this as their strong hold that they can do these chores of cooking and gardening better than anyone else because it's been in their character since ages, they are the ones who maintained everything and supported others on the back end by doing all these activities. We can't even assume the history without the women who did all these domestic activities standing at the back end holding the strongest will for supporting. These Domestic activities are no less than the pillars of support ij daily life. So Feminists should surely reclaim domestic activities as empowering. ","As Taliban took the control over Afghanistan last year, many nations stated that if Talibani govt. don't violate the rights of citizens in any manner than they would get slightest idea to recognize but in fact Taliban started doing the exact opposite as they have curbed the most fundamental rights of citizens specifically of women, as Taliban just removed the right to education for women and banned the entry of girls and women in educational institutions which is very disgraceful idea. After this move, most nations have just stepped back from recognizing Islamic emirate of Taliban. Since Taliban took the control over Afghanistan, it's facing backlash from most nations and by the time it would just increase day by day. Even the Arabic countries are not extending support, they have also stated that we don't recognise Taliban regime as legitimate government in any manner.

Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering. These activities are often seen as ""women's work"" which is a form of oppression, but reclaiming them as empowering through a feminist lens can help to challenge and transform traditional gender roles. Gardening and cooking can be empowering when it is done in a way that allows women to reclaim their power, autonomy and creativity. By reclaiming these activities, feminists can challenge the idea that domestic activities are only suitable for women, and can instead create a more equitable and just society.","No, the United Nations should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

As such, it does not meet the criteria for recognition by the United Nations as a legitimate government.

5,1,Tanmay Jain,"In the recent past we have seen a dramatic shift in the composition of the work-force with more and more women being encouraged to work and earn a living for themselves which is absolutely a tremendous stride that society has taken in terms of equality of opportunity but since life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, this change in mindset has also been accompanied by a set of arbitrary and supposedly preconceived notions that engaging in domestic activities somehow makes women inferior. Young women in particular have started to associate household work, raising children and having a family without  an enslaving corporate career as a form of oppression. What seems to amaze me is the fact that these people have this misconstrued idea of what feminism has historically stood for and the subsequent interpretations of it don’t really translate well into the modern era either. We are living in a society that has been blatantly lying to women, lying about the fact that in order to be considered a high value woman, they necessarily need to work a job and exhibit inherently masculine traits and all that while the puppet masters have been trying to feminize men. I am all for the equality of opportunity, I believe every person irrespective of their gender should have the option of choosing their career according to their own liking but at the same time we need to remember that traditional gender roles evolved they way they did for a reason and pursuing your dreams while taking responsibility for roles that were and are considered a non negotiable responsibility of a particular gender (male or female) should not be shamed or looked down upon. The farther we stray from modernity, the closer we’ll come towards traditional and allegedly oppressive roles and that’s a fact that people need to embrace instead of complain about. Women still want masculine, competent men that protect and provide and men still want feminine, caring women that protect their spirits, their home and their family, so accept everything else as a bonus and don’t confuse oppression with responsibilities that should be embraced and I think if everyone does just that then we’ll all be ten times happier.","The situation in Afghanistan is a prime example of the inability of the west to keep its promises to Afghan nationals. Everywhere the US and its allies go, they convert homes and farms into a warzone, profiteering off of the dead and helpless.

The objective of the UN isn’t to decide which state has legitimate rulers, it’s to provide states a platform to discuss their concerns, it's a platform for debate and discourse, granted a highly ineffective one but that’s not the point, the point is irrespective of them knowing that Afghanistan is in the hands of Islamic extremists, they should still identify them as the government of Afghanistan. If not being ruled by a bunch of insane individuals was a precondition to being a legitimate state then I’m afraid that the UN would have less than half the members it has today. North Korea, China, Pakistan, Iran all get to represent themselves at the UN and I don’t think it should be any different for the Taliban led Afghanistan. One might make an argument stating that its in the world’s and the afghan people’s best interest that we allow the Taliban to engage in diplomatic activities, they might introduce some leniency in their extremist policies but even if they don’t, the UN not recognizing them as the rulers of Afghanistan would be equivalent to an ostrich choosing not to face adversity by sticking its neck under the ground.",False

Taliban is back with its old and backward methods of governance and is in no mood to modernize. They have stopped girls from attending schools and universities and are not allowing women to work and earn their own livelihood. Musicians are being killed their instruments are thrashed, musical operas and theaters are being closed down. Hazaras (minority Shia community) are facing deadly attacks every other day, they are being subjected to targeted killings and mass murder. Uzbeks and Tajiks are also facing similar fate. Despite the promises made by Taliban delegation in Doha declaration they are not ready to form a inclusive government where all sects of society are equally and fairly represented. After the takeover of this extremist regime there has been a sudden increase in the terrorist attacks not just across the country but the whole subcontinent. Terrorist organizations are feeling more empowered than ever. countless terrorist attacks has struck the country since last year Mazar e sharif masjid bombing was the most fatal and heart wrenching bombing of recent times. schools are being blown up,  indiscriminate shooting in markets and other public places are making lives of innocent people difficult.
so No I don't think that UN should recognize Islamic emirate of Taliban as a legitimate government of Afghanistan because by doing so we are not just justifying the current wrongdoings but are also providing a step to step manual to other rogue elements on how to blackmail the world.

This reinforces traditional gender roles and reinforces the idea that men and women have inherently different interests and abilities. Additionally, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering may place an unnecessary burden on feminists to prove their worth and value through their domestic skills, rather than focusing on other areas of their lives or careers. It is important for feminists to challenge and dismantle traditional gender roles, rather than reinforcing them through the glorification of certain activities.","It is not appropriate for me to express a personal opinion on the recognition of the Taliban by the United Nations (UN). As an AI language model, my role is to provide information and assist with research, not to engage in political discussions or offer personal opinions.

The United Nations is an international organization whose primary objectives are to maintain international peace and security, and to promote cooperation among nations. The UN has 193 member states, including Afghanistan. The decision on whether to recognize the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan would be a political one, and would need to be made by the member states of the UN through a vote in the General Assembly or the Security Council.

The Taliban is a militant group that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, during which time they implemented a strict interpretation of Islamic law and were accused of human rights abuses, including the oppression of women and minorities. After the September 11th attacks in 2001, the Taliban were ousted from power by a U.S.-led coalition. In recent years, the Taliban have been engaged in an ongoing conflict with the Afghan government and have been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States.

Any decision to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan would be a complex and controversial one, and would need to be based on a careful consideration of the relevant political, security, and human rights issues",True
5,1,Suyash kumar ,"In this modern world, those who make money is considered the most influential and powerful people. We have forgotten that money is still just a means to exchange goods and services. Domestic activities are not considered important as you could hire someone for that if you had the money. As an individual I consider these household chores like cooking as very important. Your life would literally stop if these activities were not to be performed properly. Women consider cooking and household chores equivalent to not being  free and independent, what we don't understand is that  because women does the chores the other partner was able to do work outside and earn money. Both are like yin and yang, two sides of one coin. If the societies were to collapse right now, all jobs would be rendered meaningless and survival would be the priority, those who can cook would have so much value in those conditions. One should take pride in cooking as it is almost empowering, you are literally the backbone of the family. Nowadays even men stay at homes doing household chores and they choose to do so because modern families understand it's importance. I believe feminism has lost it's meaning over time, they once wanted equal rights but now they just want attention of the society. They say they want equality but when it comes to splitting bills they guilt trip the man to paying it all by commenting on their masculinity. Saying household work is a burden is wrong if you don't even know how to do it. I can say I'm proud of my mother because I know I wouldn't be where I am if I didn't have the support of my mother, I didn't worry about washing clothes, making dinner etc. because my mother was there for me.

We know that in March 2020 the UN security council already decided that they would neither recognize nor “support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.” and i stand by their decision.

5,1,Yash Agarwal,"  I strongly agree with the statement that, ‘Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking, etc.) as empowering.’
Domestic work is no more gender specific today and any true feminist accepts that. While the men are still mocked, and women are still pressured to do the work, it is our responsibility to take up this social issue, spread some awareness and change the mindset of society. Empowering females doesn’t only mean making them do the work males have been doing. Feminism is not just about fighting for the fair share of women in the industry and development, but also about protecting their will. If a woman loves to do housework and wants to do only that, it should not be all connected with patriarchy or male supremacy. Instead, the focus should be upon empowering women and their work. Then only true equality can be expected.
Various myths have been created and the things have been distorted to meet personal motives. A work is a work, whether a man does it or a woman. Doing house chores doesn’t make someone more feminine or less free. Feminists are influential and seem to connect to many around the world, so it becomes necessary for them to take up these thoughts and spread them to the groups. People accept them emotionally and think that they work for the good of women, so it becomes their responsibility to take up the right message.
What we do gets reflected in society. So, attempts should be made to normalize the work as gender non-specific. Only then would we be able to progress socially and personally, individually and as a group.","
  I do not believe that the UN should recognize the Islamic Emirates of Taliban. While the UN is an international body for protecting rights and ensuring the development of its member nations, what Talibani government is doing goes against it. The government is not elected or approved by the public of the country. Instead, it is a forced rule.
The women are deprived of their rights to move freely around the country. Girl children are denied open education. The voices of resistance are being suppressed. The cruel patriarchal and totalitarian rule is being established. The basic human rights are at stake. Freedom has become subjective. All this is against the principles of the UN and also of a free nation.
Someone is shot in the head because he/she doesn’t follow the cruel rules made by the government. Children are forced to take up arms and promote terrorism by violence. With this, nothing can be achieved. A nation develops when its people have their share in rule, when they are heard and taken care of. Accepting the government would mean accepting the Talibani mindset and would become a green signal for them to give even more suffering to the citizens. This would encourage other dictators to establish their rule.
Allowing the darkness to exist means allowing it to spread and extinguish all the lamps. Instead of accepting the government, the UN should condemn the actions of the government. It should keep its close eye upon the events taking place in the country and monitor the violation of rights. It is the responsibility of all the democratic and semi-democratic nations to protect the victims of the cruel rule and the UN is the right medium to do so.

As I am student in top college of Delhi , we see that both genders work together with respect to each other and we also appreciate each other and at the same time we know that a large chunk of population don't appreciate/admire the hard work women put in household work which is damn hard . I clear jee by rigorous hardwork but I gat what I deserve and thats all fine but I see my mother working in house putting more or same hardwork but we take it for granted that it's ok 
But I think there is a miscommunication of thaught between two diff gender 
As all human which is busy in her/his life his mind focus on self and don't able to appreciate others either it will be other human or nature , as we know what a beautiful world we have but most of the time we not appreciate it 
As a society we make certain Norms that female do this and man do that but now it's both gender responsibility specially those who have some common sense (not so common in everyone)
That as a society / company/house/ any group ,if we respect other person work and just do a little appreciation which cause huge respect bond between them and as a team they experience the compounding effect in their growth in any journey
But in starting if no one appreciate female they first start respecting their work themself and then world will automatically start appreciate their work ","I write about second topic 
First of all i make you very clear about my pov 
I think un , Uno , world bank is only a thinks to say but main backside work is done by usa 
I think if you see all the major war / activities in the world majority of time usa is present directly or indirectly 
As in afganistan ,. Clearly a brutal failule by Americans as they won't achieve their goal but at the same time they left many weapons in afganistan worth in billion with itself proves that Americans not stop they , they think in long term 
In UN , I think un should put eye on Taliban activity around the world and if they found any misleading activity done by Taliban then they take action on them

1. As of now I see a great relationship between India and afganistan and we benefit from the trade with afganistan
2. There is also Pakistan factor as we see usa is backing actively to Pakistan we need to make strong relationship with afganistan as india and afganistan surround the Pakistan Land and in bad time we both make nose bloody
3. Un should make sure that people in afganistan get their basic need and freedom through Taliban specially the female and children in afganistan

46,0,Soham Patial,"Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights .Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering. Well there should be someone who  hold the accountability for gardening and cooking but the ironical part is when gardening and cooking are considered as jobs . The men are stereotypically held accountable whereas when gardening and cooking are considered to be as household work or domestic activites  everyone wants food cooked by their mother. top chefs are males .This is where feminists role is important. Women's empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics
Popularised feminist discourse has devalued daily cooking and implicitly defined it as work that reinforces women’s second-class status. For some reason, the task of doing household chores is looked down upon. But that’s what brings in harmony to the family. When you can find a socks at the place it’s supposed to be.

Honestly, it’s difficult to manage work and chores. Don’t stereotype it to be a women’s task. For a better society and family, it’s high time that we all share our responsibilities.","Recently Afghanistan was annexed by Taliban and The takeover was widely criticized by the international community, and no countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the new regime, despite nominally maintaining relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban has aggressively campaigned for international recognition since the takeover. Several countries have vowed never to recognize the Islamic Emirate, and others have said they will do so only if human rights are respected. The Taliban previously ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and received limited diplomatic recognition, with the United Nations and most countries continuing to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan, which the Taliban had reduced to a rump state. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged other countries not to recognize the Islamic Emirate as the legitimate government of Afghanistan .Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has stated that the UK ""will not recognise the Taliban as the new government in Kabul"" but will be willing to engage in direct communications with the group. The second Taliban government is not recognized by the United Nations, which instead continues to recognize the Islamic Republic as the country's legitimate government.

In an era of climate change linked to industrialised foods and disease epidemics caused by the modern Western diet, kitchen work has acquired political importance. Daily cooking must be understood as public, as well as private. Neither feminist theorists nor environmental educators have integrated cooking in the kitchen, specifically, into discourse. By examining two local foods activist groups, we measure one site where feminists value cooking, and we develop a feminist theory of gender-inclusivity. Based on our survey, feminists who cook with local foods are only beginning to ideologically integrate feminism and sustainable foods cooking; however, we argue that in practice, the connection is strong and that it is time to conceptualise a new discourse on the kitchen for a feminist-environmental theory of cooking.","The Taliban are a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. 

Following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the original regime in 2001, the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory less than ten years after their ouster. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. The group’s swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.

The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.

Meal time is a nurturing factor that makes households actual homes, yet this too has pretty well gone by fewer and fewer with time . But I do agree that the domestically inclined person in the family does not need to be the woman. In fact, I strongly believe that if we're going to be reclaiming domesticity and housework as an environmental and moral good, it needs to be done by both men and women.

5,1,Yash vashist,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering because these activities have historically been associated with women and have often been used to limit their roles and opportunities. By actively engaging in and valuing these activities, feminists can challenge and deconstruct these oppressive gender roles and expectations, and reclaim them as sources of pride, creativity, and personal fulfillment. Additionally, domestic activities like gardening and cooking can provide a sense of connection to nature and community, and can be powerful tools for self-sufficiency and self-care.




","It is not appropriate for me to provide an opinion on the recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (the Taliban's name for the government of Afghanistan) by the United Nations (UN). The UN is an international organization that works to maintain international peace and security, promote international cooperation, and protect human rights. It is up to the member states of the UN, through their representatives in the UN General Assembly and the Security Council, to decide on the recognition of any particular government.
The recognition of a government by the UN is a complex and nuanced process that takes into account a range of factors, including the government's adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, its respect for the rule of law and human rights, and its ability to effectively govern the country and represent the will of its people. It is also important to consider the broader regional and international context, as well as the potential implications of recognition for peace and stability in the region.
I encourage you to learn more about the UN and its role in international relations, as well as the specific processes and criteria that are involved in the recognition of governments by the UN.

And history also speaks it, they have Doing it for the long time,  so naturally they are more good at handling these household works. For example,if you see the history its always the men who go out for a war not women , why because its their duty NO!! Its purely out of the fact that they are more physically capable than women and survive in Extreme conditions compared to women. Similarly , women are also good handling multiple works more efficiently than men,more wiser in making strategies also. As a man or as a women, you 'll always achieve more if you do the work thats suits to your natural profile. That is why I believe women should actively reclaim the houshold work as empowering ,  because they are more capable of Doing so and also they are even better than most of the men out there.

5,1,Arunima Banerjee,"I will be writing for the motion. Empowerment of women is an important interest of feminists. The large scale industry of hotel management which includes domestic chores like cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc has men in the most important positions. The irony is that homemakers, who are majorly females even today, practice the same chores without any remuneration. 

Feminists can herein find a way to empower the female population. From an economic perspective, women in the household can join the hotel industry at various levels. A major part of empowerment being financial independence, this could be a good solution.

In a broader outlook, household chores are indeed the backbone of any family. In today's world, we mostly have nuclear families. The homemakers are the least appreciated because of the lack of financial independence. Yet, we overlook the comfort that a homemaker gives to their family. They take care of cooking, cleaning, gardening and all other activities without which the earning member of the family cannot find comfort. Feminism essentially means equality for all. We do propagate the idea of division of household work, which is of course the way a family should be. Especially for families where the couple is working and there is to designated homemaker. But when we consider the case of couples where there is one earning member and one homemaker, we need to understand deeper problems. People often don't give the same respect to the work of the earning member and the homemaker, entirely based on economic remuneration.

If one thinks that women should claim their responsibility of handling chores , then it means that this is a women's job which is incorrect in itself.

5,1,Mayank Vats,"I am FOR this motion; Domestic activities shouldn’t be seen as demeaning or in some ways less important than outdoor activities. In my experience, the dignity of domestic labour is seldom recognized. As the contemporary movements advance maybe a lot of us have forgotten what they actually stand for. At their very core, they stand for ones’ sacrosanct Right to Choose. In my opinion choosing to do household work is as empowering as choosing to work outside, because a CHOICE was made, a path was CHOSEN and not imposed. A great example I could cite is women protesting to wear a hijab in India where it finds itself under scrutiny while women in Iran protest the hijab mandates. These protests may seem very different but at their core, they fight for the right to choose their attire and not have a third party dictate their lifestyle. Household activities being seen as somehow oppressive is no better than forcing women to work indoors, the call for abolition of society defined roles isn’t a result of them being inherently oppressive and evil, but is a result of a lack of choice that people had when it came to choosing their life. If household work is reclaimed as empowering, we would see a much better quality of life for both men and women as today many folks view doing household work as degrading themselves to second class citizens. So, as we move forward with abolishing these roles, we mustn’t start demonizing them, we mustn’t rob people of making a choice that we wouldn’t or we’d be no better than the oppressors of the past.","It is never a good idea to have enemies. Following this principle, I think, countries should maintain a diplomatic presence in Afghanistan. I do not suggest that countries get friendly with the likes of Taliban, but in my opinion, it is better to maintain an acquaintance-like diplomatic presence there. A plethora of military operations have been conducted in Afghanistan, but in the end, we find ourselves in this situation nonetheless. As we move forward a better approach is needed to tackle terrorism and oppression in the area. If the UN members don’t maintain a presence in Afghanistan, the newly formed power gap will be exploited by bad actors in the area for their own advantage and being in the middle east Afghanistan finds no shortage of terrorist regimes alike it in its neighbourhood. As the newly formed government yearns for legitimacy on the global scale, it is important for neutral nations to step in and try and prevent Afghanistan from slipping even further into the dark ages. The UN can use Taliban’s fear of being rejected at the international scale to maintain some sort of humanity in the region via diplomacy. Owing to Taliban’s incompetent regime, it is only natural that it would want support of other nations in maintaining infrastructure, instead of allowing other terrorist regimes to do so, the UN can step in and prevent this, all the while using this leverage to reduce the Taliban cruelty in the region. Reign of barbarians would descend upon the Afghan if the Taliban was left to its own devices. The situation, in my opinion, would get even worse if Afghanistan faces global isolation.",False
5,1,Shraavani Jha ,"I, Shraavani, strongly oppose the motion that ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (gardening, cooking etc.) as empowering"". Does my highly knowledgeable opponent believe that confining women within the four walls of the household will aid feminism in any way? Will it promote gender equality? Or will it help eliminate any sort of gender bias already ingrained so deep inside our collective souls?

On the contrary, the motion that feminists should actively ""reclaim"" housework has no sound basis at all. Where is the question of ""reclaiming"" something that hasn't been let go of in the first place? I dare you to visit any household in our country. It is highly likely that the women and the daughters of the house will be at the helm of completing the household chores. Women doing all the housework, the unpaid labor that no one thanks them for, is the norm. Even as we pride ourselves on being part of the new, ""woke"" generation. 

In fact, most women today have to work two ""shifts"". One outside the house, which fetches them their salary, and the other inside the house, which, as you all know, are the ""domestic activities"", cooking, cleaning, and the like. This is often referred to as the ""double burden"" of women's work. If the time that women spend working both ways is accounted for, it would exceed much beyond their male counterparts, and leave so little time for leisure.

Going by the dictionary definition of the word ""Feminist"", it stands for an advocate of women's rights based on the principle of ""equality"" of the sexes. Now tell me what kind of ""equality"" is being spoken about if a self-respecting feminist has to actively ""reclaim"" domestic activities as empowering? It's like women are being asked to go down the same proverbial rabbit hole of the gender molds that our society has constructed for them.

Empowerment is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. What better way to be empowered than to be in charge of your own finances, right? Housework isn't going to fetch a woman anything more than at best, a weekly allowance for buying groceries. Getting a paycheck in your hands by working a regular job and pursuing her interests will, however, make a woman actually empowered.  ","The recent change of government in Afghanistan, and its annexation by the Taliban, is a development that has been given substantial coverage in the international press. And the attention isn't uncalled for, keeping in view the various ""things"" they have been found guilty of blatantly doing.

The ball was set rolling in September 2020, when over 5,000 Taliban prisoners were released by the Afghanistan government as part of a deal between the United States and the Taliban. These ""experts"" returned to the Taliban to strengthen it. In due course, within a year, the Taliban went on a literal capturing spree in which it seized hold of the entirety of the land. 

They were found to have committed various war crimes such as the cold-blooded murder of surrendering armies as well as killing journalists reporting from the ground. Even before they had established control over the country, a mass exodus of civilian Afghans, who were abhorrent of a repeat Taliban regime, was triggered. More than 124,000 emigrants were reported to have fled. 

The Taliban has been perceived to be, and rightly so, to be misogynist and strikingly violent against women. In a systematic segregation which can be safely referred to as gender apartheid, women have not been licensed to work, and they do not have permission to be educated after the age of eight. Women are subjected, constantly, to brutalities that the Taliban defends under the veil of the Islamic ""Sharia"" law. The Taliban has also been found responsible for ""cultural genocide"" against the Afghan people, destroying historical texts and artefacts. 

The hardline Islamist group, upon grabbing the reins of power, has also led the downward spiral of the Afghan economy, leaving civilians to struggle for even the most basic amenities. The promise that the Taliban had made- that to secure peace and stability for the Afghans- hasn't been fulfilled, nor will it be in the near future, by the look of things.

Since Afghanistan is being ruled by a terrorist organization which is guilty of gross human rights abuses and is not a democratically elected government, this amounts to violation of the UN Charter of which it is a signatory. Hence the UN, in all fairness, must not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. ",False
5,1,Anjali Singh ,"I am with the motion , feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities. Domestic activities are not always a burden , being somehow engaged in such activities like gardening is good for a person because if many reasons, you get to know about flowers ,plants and other flora through this , as how could the fact be ignored that nature calms us , not just physical but also mental pleasure . As a women perspective, women are in household activities a lot but not very often they do that willingly , but if they do that whenever they feel like doing , it would be fun rather then being a unpaid job . Gardening and other outdoor activities will balance  women's repetitive, useless chores with pleasure, fun and entertainment. Sometimes cooking just not to feed others but for yourself,like to give yourself a treat would keep one happy , and make life worth living and more lively . Doing some domestic activities just for  yourself will make not limit a person's work life and provide with a lot of activities thats good overall .A man would not be limited to his office works or other outdoor stuffs and on the other hand as women should give a hand to other pleasing activities as well rather than doing her defined works only either it be the 
 professional one or for their family . Women somewhere are like we won't do cooking , don't know how to cook because they feel as if it's not their duty , offcourse it's not a duty but we need to know how to feed ourselves, not for others but for ourselves we need to know how to cook.The same implies to other domestic chores as well like cleaning your living space , doing laundry etc .So at last I agree ,, feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities.","Afganistan and it's residents going through a phase of unrest since a long time , since the annexation of Taliban started decades back .

Even the basic rights , like right to freedom being declined. United Nations need to look after this and should not to give a green flag to Islamic Emirates of Taliban . United Nations was formed to look after conflicts around and world and make thing work with non violence.  So now here every getting turned upside down and un being silent ,not paying a heed to this matter, are they waiting for Talibans to spread terror in the whole world and terrorise the so called powerful nations like US . People in afganistan need to be helped out and deserve freedom and their every right back and for this UN need to help them out . It's right now a matter of concern for afganistan but soon could be a danger to the globe .

5,1,Amisha Balwani,"I vote against the motion, 'Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.' 
Not everything is acceptable in the name of 'Feminism' and 'Empowerment'. I believe that these terms are not so flexible. It took years of struggles, Rights Movements, and Revolutions for our women to reach the position they stand in today. Do we want them to go back to square one and be tied to the kitchen? Moreover, this time we even have the audacity to tell them that this is for their empowerment. 
I agree that domestic activities require strength. Homemaking without any doubt needs patience, hard labor, and management skills. In no way it is less than the other ways of making a living. However, 'Money isn't Everything, but Everything needs Money.' Ultimately, everything narrows down to Money. The one who earns receives the most credit and is given the utmost level of authority. Homemaking becomes backstage work since no money is earned, it is taken for granted. 
Thus, I strongly believe that feminists need not claim domestic work as empowering. Every task and opportunity should be equally available for men and women. With this, I shall rest my case.
","In my opinion, the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. 
There is not one, but innumerable reasons which I believe the UN can never concede to the Talibani government. Despite pledges of moderation and reform taken by many of their factions, one year later those predictions have largely turned out to be prescient. Just a few days ago, universities for women were banned until further notice. The ministry of 'Women Affairs' was first emptied, and then expectedly filled with all 'male' members. The Taliban claim to have an 'interim' cabinet but have taken steps to establish a more permanent government. They are far away from drafting a formal constitution, and Afghanistan lacks the basis of rule of law. Taliban have posed a threats to many communities within the country, carrying out invasive raids and arrests in neighborhoods home to ethnic Tajiks from Panshir and other regions where anti-Taliban resistance has been most active. Reports of extrajudicial killings, among former security forces and suspected anti-Taliban groups, number in the hundreds. It seems unbelievable that their law allows public humiliation, flogging, whipping, execution, and amputation of limbs, of Men and Women. With a free press almost nonexistent and no legitimate judiciary, the Taliban Government does not deserve to be recognized by the UN. ",False

Introduction from the WSA

Feminism, at its core, is singular in its intent: equality of the sexes. Yet it’s often been called “the other F-word.” A dirty word. 

But what does it mean when we think that a synonym for “champion for equal rights” is an affront? When it’s thrown around by both men and women in boardrooms and classrooms, like an insult on the proverbial playground? 

We didn’t know. So, we talked to allies and advocates, skeptics and critics. 

We asked of them, and ourselves: What does it mean to be a feminist? What does it mean to uphold the values of gender equity? How can we stand with and advocate for women of all backgrounds? Why are so many people allergic to the word “feminism”? 

This isn’t to ignore the very real and warranted criticism of the origins of the largely white, heterosexual, cisgender, able-bodied feminist movement. But it is to push for an intersectional future, one we want you to join us in building. 

Thus, this campaign was born: to reclaim the word feminist to mean “a believer in equal rights for all genders,” without regard to race or religion or ethnicity, sexual orientation or sex assignment at birth, gender expression or hormonal makeup, marital status or family size, socioeconomic status, visible or non-visible disabilities, level of education, and more. ","The Taliban are a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. 

Following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the original regime in 2001, the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory less than ten years after their ouster. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. The group’s swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.

The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.

","The Taliban have announced an interim government in Afghanistan, declaring the country an ""Islamic Emirate"".
The Taliban has taken control of Afghanistan, as of 16th August 2021. The quick collapse of the government in Afghanistan, and the Taliban taking over the presidential palace, seem to have triggered panic and fear among the people in Afghanistan, many of whom are taking flights to escape the country. President Ashraf Ghani fled the country on 15th August, reportedly to Tajikistan, although this is not confirme. The taliban government was not recognized by the United Nations, which instead continued to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

""The Islamic Emirate has fulfilled the criteria and norms necessary for recognition in the world,

5,1,Aryan Sharma,"Domestic activities, such as gardening, cooking, and cleaning, have historically been associated with femininity & have been seen as demeaning because they are associated with a lack of power and agency. They have been used to oppress and discriminate against women. As a result, some feminists believe that these activities should be reclaimed as empowering and should be viewed as valid and important work. This perspective is known as ""domestic feminism"" or ""housewife feminism."" I believe that traditional gender roles, which often assign domestic work to women and paid work outside the home to men, are oppressive and should be challenged. By actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists can challenge and subvert these traditional gender roles. Domestic work is often undervalued and not recognized as important or valid work, so by actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists can help to value and respect the contributions that women make through this work. Some feminists believe that women should be able to choose whether or not to engage in domestic work, and that this choice should be respected regardless of their gender and by actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists can support this choice and encourage women to feel empowered to engage in domestic work if they so choose. However, it is important to recognize that not all feminists agree with this perspective. Some feminists believe that the focus on domestic work reinforces traditional gender roles and that women should be encouraged to participate in paid work outside the home.

There has been a significant increase in the number of immigrants, particularly those from Central America, who have attempted to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in recent years. This has been driven in part by economic, political, and social factors in the countries of origin, including poverty, violence, and persecution. The illegal crossing of the border has often involved the use of smugglers, who charge large fees to help people cross the border and often subject them to dangerous and inhumane conditions. The illegal border crossing has also been associated with a range of illegal activities, including drug trafficking and human smuggling, which can have significant negative impacts on both the United States and Mexico. In the United States, the illegal immigration has been a contentious political issue and has led to the deployment of military personnel to the border and the construction of physical barriers. It has also resulted in the detention of large numbers of immigrants in detention facilities, which have faced criticism for their conditions and treatment of detainees. In Mexico, the illegal immigration has placed a strain on the country's resources and has contributed to a rise in crime and violence in some areas. The Mexican government has faced criticism for its handling of the issue, including its efforts to prevent illegal immigration and its treatment of immigrants who are apprehended within its borders. The United States has been struggling with illegal immigration for decades, and it has become a major political issue. Illegal immigrants are often blamed for taking jobs from Americans, committing crimes, and burdening the welfare system. The Mexican government has also been struggling with illegal immigration for decades. In recent years, the number of Central American migrants crossing into Mexico has increased dramatically. Some possible solutions for this might be improving economic and social conditions in Mexico and other Central American countries, which could help reduce the push factors that drive people to migrate to the United States. Another one can be implementing measures to better enforce U.S. immigration laws and to deter illegal immigration, such as increasing the use of technology and other resources to monitor and patrol the border. Also providing assistance and support to immigrants who are already living in the United States, including access to education, healthcare, and other social services might be one of the difference maker.",False
5,1,Kunal Gangwar,"Feminism is about breaking free from traditional gender roles and expectations that have been used to oppress and discriminate against women. Things like gardening and cooking are often associated with women and used to reinforce those traditional roles. By reclaiming these activities as empowering and enjoyable, feminists can challenge and subvert those harmful stereotypes.

In addition to challenging those harmful stereotypes, domestic activities can give us a sense of accomplishment and connection to our home and community. These activities can be fulfilling and enjoyable, rather than just being seen as a burden or a chore. In a world that often prioritizes professional achievement over personal fulfillment, being able to do things that bring meaning and purpose to our lives can be especially valuable.

Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also be a way to resist against the capitalist system, which often relies on exploiting women's unpaid labor, including domestic work. By valuing and reclaiming those activities, feminists can challenge the idea that they aren't worthy of recognition and respect. This not only helps to challenge and subvert traditional gender roles, but it also highlights the value and importance of unpaid labor, which is often undervalued and underappreciated in our society.

Plus, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also be a way to create a more inclusive and intersectional feminism. By valuing and celebrating activities that have often been associated with women, we can help create a more diverse and inclusive movement that recognizes and values the experiences and perspectives of all feminists.

Overall, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can be a meaningful and valuable way for feminists to challenge harmful stereotypes, find personal fulfillment, resist against capitalist exploitation, and create a more inclusive and intersectional movement.","The situation of immigrants trapped between the US-Mexico border is a desperate one that illustrates the complex and often desperate circumstances that many people face in their search for a better life. The rise of illegal activities, like human trafficking and smuggling, has had a huge impact on both the United States and Mexico. These activities can contribute to crime, violence, and social unrest.

One major factor contributing to the perilous situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is the lack of legal ways for them to migrate to the United States. Many people turn to illegal means of migration, like crossing the border without documents or paying smugglers, because they can't get visas or other legal permission to enter the country. This lack of legal options can be due to various reasons, like strict immigration policies, long processing times, or a lack of available visas for certain categories of immigrants.

The rise of illegal activities at the border can also have negative consequences for both the United States and Mexico. In the United States, illegal immigration can strain resources and lead to social and political tensions. In Mexico, the involvement of organized crime in smuggling and trafficking can contribute to violence and corruption.

To address the desperate situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border, it's important to find solutions that tackle the root causes of illegal immigration and address the needs and concerns of all stakeholders. This could involve expanding legal channels for migration, improving the efficiency and fairness of the immigration process, and addressing the economic and social factors that drive people to migrate in the first place. It could also involve efforts to crack down on illegal activities at the border, like human trafficking and smuggling, and to provide support and assistance to immigrants who are caught in difficult and dangerous situations.

But feminists should claim for domestic works as empowerment. If they told about equality then in household chores that equality should holds. Women should not only doing offices works, running laptops. They do not participate in household chores by saying that they are tired by doing work . But man is also a human ,he also tired. So doing household chores should not be considered as inequality. Feminists should understood women that a happy married life runs when bot husband and wife share works and doing all domestic works together.

And due to all this illegal activities also increasing at borders like illegal immigration, kidnappings, drug smuglers etc. It creates a great impact on both the countries, their citizens are going into Hale by illegal activities , their future generations are in danger. As it is a crisis so it requires a fundamental rethinking of how to manage border and migration . Solution of this is not by doubling security as Trump administration demanded. But the other solutions exists in this like increase number of courts and judges in a reformed asylum system. Do not speed cases to the detriment of due process, expand access to legal counsel. Asylum seekers should be steered from rural sites towards the ports,not the other way around.

5,1,Kashish Verma,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic violence as empowering, I support this statement as all the household work which women do in their daily lives is essential for them as well as for the whole family. If we talk about the times we are living in currently, most of us are active upon topics such as women empowerment, domestic violence etc. all this leads us to being a society of people who constantly want women to be empowered and take a step forward for their own opinions and value of existence in society. When all this comes into action we see women as an evolving part of society which is inclined towards being stronger and better. With this, our society gave birth to a notion called feminism which has taken a major control over how we see women as an integral part of welfare and support of mankind. Feminists as believed have beliefs in social, economic and political equality of sexes.
For people who support feminism, certain works such as domestic household etc could possibly showcase a vulnerable side of women but as fas as feminism is considered, it believes in equality of sexes, defining a work system on the basis of gender is unfair.

5,1,ARPITA ARORA,"""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering"", but at what cost? At the cost, the teenage girls working in households being treated inhumanely just for the sake of a month's salary or the corporate sector ladies already hustling with their 9 to 5 jobs, completing the laundry till midnight just because her husband was not supposed to do it as a result of our gender biased society? 
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, today I Arpita Arora, am going to present my views against the motion ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering"".
As defined by Wikipedia, women empowerment is the process of helping a woman to achieve her status in every sphere of life. But does our society really help a woman to build up her status? We all, be it college going students or the working-class love to have a mug of coffee in our cozy beds as we return, but is the condition of the bed the same when we wake up in the morning? Have we ever cared, who cleaned our messy room? Just because of the fact, housework is something a woman does which nobody notices unless it is not done.

In today's era, domestic chores are not considered an option for empowering woman because of the kind of attitude the society possesses towards these professions such as that of a gardener. A washerwoman's children are deprived of all the opportunities they deserve, just because they are kids of a servant. 

In a parallel universe, where there is a separate private company which takes care of the trees and the pollution level in the environment, thereby giving its employees the tag of ""Domestic Environmentalists"", with sufficient salary to support their families, and at home an equal right to make family decisions, just like men, the ladies of the generation may happily opt to open more and more beautiful plant nurseries. In the kind of world, where the lady of the house is welcomed home with the dinner ready, irrespective of being the head chef at a five-star hotel, cooking may be reclaimed as a way of empowering women. 

""Men are from Earth. Women are from Earth. Deal with it"", unquote George Carlin. Unless and until, the women handling these domestic chores are given acceptance and importance in the society, the question of empowerment does not rise, because empowerment starts from equality and equality starts from home. ","The Taliban, meaning ""Students"" in Pashto, is a Sunni Islamic Organization, notorious for imposing the rigid Islamic Law all over the State of Afghanistan. Though, the organization was formed in 1994, after collectively fighting the Soviet forces in 1980, in partnership with the former Afghanistan forces, their anti-democratic rule over the country for more than a decade led to mass destruction within the country. They imposed severe restrictions over all the citizens such as women required to wear burqas covering all their bodies and men required to grow beards. Girls above the age of eight, were banned from attending school, women barred from playing sports, and television, music, kite-flying, cinema and photography were supposed to be like aliens for the citizens under the Taliban rule. Above all these, mass-killings, bloodshed and massacres against civilians conducted by the Taliban, called for The United Nations intervention in establishing peace and prosperity in the State of Afghanistan, and the rest is history. 

In my opinion, UN should definitely not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, because it will not only lead to alienation of the word ""democracy"" in the country but also will make it a hub of terrorist activities. Earlier as well, the US Army invaded Afghanistan aiming to stop Taliban from providing a safe-haven to Al-Qaeda, that is Osama Bin Laden planning to make Afghanistan its operation hub for terrorist activities.
Recently, under the Taliban governance, girls have been banned from attaining University education, which has again given rise to an environment of heat and discussion in the country. Countries such as China, Iraq, France and Russia have refrained from providing any kind of support or assistance to Taliban led Afghanistan, because it is not a people's government. The recapture of Afghanistan by the Taliban after a decade of war, has rose the level of violence in Kabul beyond control and declaring such a kind of government as an Islamic Emirate will not only aggravate the level of tensions in the Middle East, but also is a straight-forward contradiction to the basic principle of Islam i.e., peace. The State and the people of Afghanistan look forward to a secular, sovereign and democratic government which cannot be possible under Taliban's governance.

3,0,Amal Kumar,"For the motion

Before I start to put forward my points, I think that it’s necessary to know the definition of a feminist. According to Oxford dictionary it’s definition is “the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.” From this statement we can derive that feminism strives to give equal rights to women. This means that they should be allowed to have their own opinions and choices.
So now if talk about  a woman who loves activities such as cooking, cleaning or gardening that doesn’t mean that she is a “bad” feminist. Instead the fact that she is doing what she wants to do without having to care about the negative opinions from others(men and women alike) makes her a strong woman and should I say a brilliant feminist. It doesn’t make sense for women to abandon crucial activities like cooking, cleaning etc. just because they are traditionally female activities. Rather they should advocate the importance of these activities and encourage people “men and women” alike to take part in them. Cooking is a very important part of our life, the fact that we know what we are putting in our body is an empowering skill. It can be meditative and lead to healthier lives overall. The same can be said about gardening as it leads to fresher produce, cleaner air and many other benefits.

I don’t mean to say that these activities are meant for women(or even men alone). Such activities are very crucial for a healthy and balanced life. So if both genders are going to abandon them it will just lead to a lower quality of life for everyone. Eating fast food everyday, having no greenery around the house or having an untidy room will eventually lead to a lot of harm. So we have to rebrand the household chores and encourage both men and women to actively participate in them.
","Given the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, should UN recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban? Justify your answer sufficiently.


I think that the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, atleast not as of now. The situation is not stable enough right now to make this big of a decision, it is still an early stage for the Taliban ruled Afghanistan to be recognized. The UN should be monitoring their activities and conditions for more extended periods of time. Moreover the Taliban is actively seeking recognition on the international scale. They are doing their best to maintain diplomacy with neighbouring countries. This is because of their poor economical condition, they are aware that they require foreign assistance to get their country back to a stable state. This condition of theirs can be hugely useful as it gives the UN and the other countries a leverage(or a bargaining power of kinds). 
So now the UN has the golden opportunity to coerce Taliban to come to a mutual agreement which favours the interests on an international level and also try to improve the lives of civilians under Taliban rule(even though this seems unlikely). As we know under the Taliban rule the lives of women have become much more difficult as they are discouraged from jobs and higher education. The ministry of women affairs no longer exists and there is not much freedom of speech as before. They have introduced the traditional law enforcement practices again.
Coming to the conclusion the UN is going to have to have the Taliban agree to some basic agreements such as maintaining human rights in their country, guaranteeing that no terrorism activities are breeding under their rule and agreeing to work in synergy with other nations. Thus the leverage which the UN has right now will be lost the moment they grant recognition to the Taliban. The UN should wait for the right moment and the right agreements.

5,1,Safal Krishna,"I am against this motion. Both men and women are two sides of the same coin. They together form a society. I would rather say women are society's backbone. If we remove the backbone from a body, the body is simply a corpse, as it can't stand on its own. First of all, we are humans; there isn't any law made by nature that says women should do domestic work. Feminists are the voice of ordinary women. We talk about equality on the basis of sex. In democratic countries like India, we have the right to equality. But where does this equality end when it comes to women's representation in the Lok Sabha? They provide reservations to women in local body elections. However, the reality is that their husbands are the true leaders; they simply serve as a signing machine. So, what's the issue when a group (feminists) speaks up?
There is no doubt women have proven themselves in different fields like science, art, medicine, television, etc. Besides this, I have not mentioned their capabilities in the fields of sports and defense. One can simply Google it to learn about women who have excelled in various fields. But this is not the complete reality. The reality is that the majority of women today work at home. We can easily target a feminist and say, ""Do this. Do that."" But what about men? Can't we teach them to help women with domestic activities? Can't we teach men to help women empower and lead a life of dignity?  
It's too foolish to say, ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening and cooking) as empowering."". It should be said that a feminist should help an ordinary, underprivileged woman realize her true potential.","No, the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. I will make my point clear by drawing an analogy with India.
In India, there are terrorist organizations like LeT, JeM, etc., and there are also Naxals in different states of India. They are heavily armed. Suppose, I wished this would never happen. But the Indian government weakens, and these terrorist organizations capture the Indian government and declare their rule. These terrorist organizations believe in the philosophy that ""political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."". Being an ordinary man, how would you feel? Yesterday you were living freely in the world's largest democracy, and now you are a slave of an extremist organization.
Now let's come back to Afghanistan. The US withdrew its military support from Afghanistan as it required a huge sum of money from the exchequer. At the same time, the Taliban, which had illegal weapons and combat systems, entered Kabul and captured it. Taliban fighters killed and raped female relatives of police commanders and soldiers. Existing government that was beneficial to the public had already been eliminated. Now people had to live under the extremist rule of the Taliban. Their liberty, their older ways of life, has gone. In the modern world, where we believe in peaceful treaties and we often avoid warlike situations, how can we support a militant group that wants to rule the world? 
We talk about eliminating terrorism and establishing a people-friendly government. But the Taliban government seems gun friendly. 
So if the UN wants to spread the message of anti-terrorism and peace, it should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. ",False
5,1,YASHITA KUMARI,"First of all thankyou for giving me opportunities talk about feminism
As being a female myself I also think feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening, cooking as empowering because being a women means nuture yourself
and others. Because we all love our mother love and devotion to us and she nuture us very much. She cooked good food for us, and do all things that nuture us. 
I also discourage toxic feminity because feminism doesn't mean that We can't do household related things and we don't have to be in home all the time. Feminism means accepting the way we are as women as also society should do the same like if a girl want to household things that's her decision and it's considered as respectful decision and also if women don't want to do household and do business work that's her decision in the society and it's also considered as respectful decision in the society . Feminism also means respecting every gender and their sexuality. And not considered her gender as superior because every gender is equal in our world.
Because god made each one of us very beautiful and unique ❤️
Thankyou ","The first two are true in the sense that the U.S. withdrew its forces, the armed forces of the previous government collapsed, and the Taliban captured power, so that violence resulting from either insurgency or counter-insurgency ceased. Taliban representatives show pride and confidence that they have, as they see it, defeated the U.S. The resultant sense of their own power makes them even more resistant to external influence than before. According to Taliban representatives, the current interim or acting (sarparast) government also has major achievements to its credit: ending over four decades of war; overseeing a massive improvement in security; and establishing stable, centralized power over the entire territory of Afghanistan for the first time in over 40 years

5,1,Ankit Sneh,"“Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering” today, I am going to speak in the motion of this argument. Feminism is the belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men whether in social, political, economical or personal expects of societies. I want to quote “koi bhi dhandha chota nhi hota, aur dhande se bada koi dharm nhi hota.” Meaning that no job is a minor compared to the other job and no religion is greater than that job.
During the 21st century, we saw an advent of liberalism and the views of the public towards gender oriented professions changed considerably, causing a change of sex ratio in these sectors. There are many male chefs such as Vikas Khanna, Ranveer Brar, Aditya Bal, fashion designers such as Rohit Bal, Manish Arora, Raghuvendra Rathore and so on. My point is to say that anyone can choose their own way of life, and are not compelled to follow society norms. 
Feminists should understand the importance of empowerment in the domestic activities too. Women empowerment in the domestic sector can be understood by taking the case of “Lijjat Papad” where seven ordinary, uneducated women started with $2capital to create a business that’s worth $213 million spread across 69 branches and employing more than 42,000 people. Thus, people can even empower themselves in domestic activities.
 For those who still think that domestic activities should be segregated on the basis of gender can never envision a developed future and can never think of breaking free from the Indian Male Chauvinistic Society.","The US – Mexico border issue is a very alarming concern for the people of both countries. The main cause of this is the increased unemployment rate in Mexico or one could say the difference of lifestyle in the two countries, causing an influx of immigrants. This increased twofold during the COVID-19 and Trump – Biden Transition. Although , the implementation of Title 42 (we can simplify it as lockdown) caused a equilibrium state, but now as COVID-19 was nearing its end, it was decided to lift this rule and the borders felt an increased  rate of immigrates, along with increased crimes and illegal immigration. The current state of immigrants cannot be explained in few words, as winter is approaching, daily necessities such as bathing, eating, sleeping are far fetched ideas. Their dreams include providing for their young ones, or sleeping in a warm bed.
This has caused an increased crime rates near borders such as illegal immigrations, drugs, human trafficking and so on. The Biden government has reduced the crime rates but its nowhere near to a stop.
This also disrupts the proper functioning of both the countries in many ways:
1.	Assimilation of Mexicans into American communities has been problematic. Many Mexicans can’t speak fluent .This can, in turn, create tension between migrants and locals which can, in extreme cases, lead to segregation, crime and violence.
2.	Mexican migrants often take low paying, menial jobs, which, while low paying, offer higher wages than what they would earn in Mexico. This was at first, advantageous, as many Americans did not want these low paying jobs but companies needed people to fill these roles. Now, as unemployment rises in America, Americans want these menial jobs but many migrants already have taken the jobs. This can lead to increased social tension as Americans believe that their jobs are being taken.
The million backlogs in immigration court cannot be solved unilaterally by any side. Even the REMAIN IN MEXICO policy failed miserably.Both  counties should agree to bilateral talks for their own people, only then they would be able to control this situation. PEACE!!!!",False
5,1,Abhishek Jethuri,"In my opinion, any job that is done at a professional level is empowering. No matter what the job is. Even if it is an unskilled labourer’s work. That is empowering and uplifting. However, domestic activities which go unpaid and unappreciated are not so much. So, I believe they should not reclaim them as empowering.
Women who are working outside and are a part of the workforce are shown to have a drastic impact on country’s development. Working women also create a diverse environment which is essential. The effect is visible in data. So, this isn’t some baseless claim. Take Japan’s case for example. When the women’s portion of workforce started skyrocketing, we clearly saw the same pattern with the economy. I know correlation is not always causation but this claim is supported by even experts.
Apart from all these reasons I also believe that calling these empowering would be the opposite of what feminism stands for. Its objective was to help women come out of these traditional stereotypes of being domestic workers.
However, the reader of this article should not interpret it in the wrong sense. Domestic skill is something that everyone must have irrespective of gender. Reclaiming them would only indicate that they're strong enough to be independent and do their own tasks without external aid. It should be an option that is available to women how they wish to live their life.
I have just touched the tip of the iceberg. Keeping women out of workforce would be a big setback on society. With all these reasons I rest my case.
","2nd Q
We all know that Taliban is, without a doubt, a terrorist organization. There is no way UN, or for that matter any legitimate country, should recognize Taliban as a legitimate government.
In the press conferences given by representatives of Taliban, we can see how hard they are trying to pose as a genuine government. If UN does it, then we would be giving to them exact thing they want. This would be bowing down in front of them. This would be a shame to humanity, freedom and peace. This would prove to the world that anything can be achieved by violence and force. A government which is built on the foundation of religion alone should not be tolerated. We wouldn’t be doing justice to people who have died fighting the Taliban.
If I were to blame someone, it would be the US (after Taliban itself). Some Americans ask “What does the world wants form us? They have a problem when we invaded Afghanistan. They have a problem when we are retreating.” I would like to answer that by saying “The problem isn’t invading or retreating. The real problem is change. Whenever there is change there will be consequences. And Afghanistan is facing them now.”
Instead of declaring it a government and calling it done, we should try to weaken down the country by reducing our trade with it, both directly and indirectly. We should try to cut all the supplies of weapons to the country. This will severely hurt Taliban. Whilst doing this we should try to induce an internal rebellion in the country. After all a country can only be freed by its own people. And when they are no longer able to fight. Taliban will automatically fall. The citizens of the country will form a new government and this time it will not be one handed to them by USA. They would earn it.

5,1,Vishwangi Raj,"i would like to write for the motion. In the course of a few years the definition of feminism has been twisted and bent as one pleases. Men and women are different. Feminism doesn’t ask us to overlook the natural differences between us. It strives for equal cerebral opportunities under all circumstances without being discriminated on basis of genders. Activities like cooking , gardening have been largely associated with the female gender in the conservative household. With the advancement in available opportunities to both sexes, women have been getting out of their “traditional roles” to be an equal wage earner (if not more) While this happened activities like cooking , cleaning have started to be looked at as largely petty jobs with both men and women refraining from doing them. Feminism wants women to get out of their homes , explore their abilities to the best of their opportunities but does not under any circumstances shames women who choose to continue to look after their families if not as a provider but as a caretaker. Everyone finds peace differently. For someone it might be cooking a hearty meal for his/her family and for someone it might be meeting deadlines at work. Likewise, men should also not be looked down upon for taking up the role of a caregiver. As a feminist myself , we stand for the upliftment of women without dragging men down. There is nothing as a “man’s job” or a “woman’s job” in todays world. All these definitions have been shattered with many more to go. Thank you.","(1)
Ah , the American dream , attracting lakhs of people to migrate from Mexico to USA illegally. People including kids suffering day in and day out just to make their way in the USA to have a better chance at life. The reason may be Job opportunities, Homophobia, poor standards of living etc. But what about the pressure it creates on the entire economy of the absorbent country ? Need of extra medical care , education , land and living expenses has to be borne by the tax given by a Native American. All this politics, makes the people suffer both sides. With the mass influx of people , it brings along with it criminal activities like human trafficking, illegal organ smuggling, drugs trafficking etc. This creates hostility among the minds of the people belonging to both countries. Mexican people are alienated from the minds of Americans (even those who have migrated to USA via a legal process) which brings an increase in the racial tensions between the two communities. On the other hand Mexico is loosing its own citizens which in turn puts a dent in it’s economy in the long run. Every country should protect its borders. There should be stricter migration laws. Better security and well communication system between the authorities of both sides. Mexican government should be more actively working towards the requirements of its own people by providing better job opportunities and offering a safer future. The legal migration process should be promoted among the people if necessary. Thank you.",False
5,1,Sanjoni Jain ,"I argue for the motion, ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" The very concept of feminism is based in equality, feminists just want women to be treated as equals to men in all aspects of life in modern society. For me, domestic activities aren’t “feminine”, because no activities should be inherently masculine or inherently feminine in the 21st century. All interests, provided they don’t cause harm to others, are valid, and more importantly equal. In modern society, physical strength is not important for success, and therefore superiority. In fact, studies show that the most “successful” people in this day and age are the people with intellectual prowess. This turns the misogynistic concept of masculinity signifying strength and femininity signifying weakness, this strength signifying superiority, obsolete. Everyone, regardless of their identifying gender, should try to be self-sufficient adults, i.e., learn the necessary skills for survival, for example cooking, finance management etc… The ability to perform domestic activities, in my opinion, are necessary skills, be it cleaning or changing a lightbulb. Providing food and money for themselves and their families has been something women have been doing for decades, but that doesn’t make managing households unnecessary. True empowerment comes from freedom to do whatever makes us happy. We can all truly be at peace with ourselves when we don’t have to worry about every small source of joy serving a greater purpose in the fight against social inequality. Feminists don’t fight against traditional femininity, they fight against the traditional inequality of women all around the world.
","I would like to start my views on immigration by saying that the issue itself is not black and white. The conclusion to the issue can’t just be to send all immigrants to their country of origin, or to accept all immigrants into the USA. I can argue for the statement by stating the economic impact of the immigrant workforce on certain states, for example Texas, having the second-largest immigration workforce in America, as a state, make $119 billion off the backs of immigrants. Moreover, according to a comparison done by PNAS based on data provided by the Texas department of public safety in the years 2012-2018 “Relative to undocumented immigrants, US-born citizens are over 2 times more likely to be arrested for violent crimes, 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and over 4 times more likely to be arrested for property crimes. In addition, the proportion of arrests involving undocumented immigrants in Texas was relatively stable or decreasing over this period.” Whereas, immigrants themselves are far more likely to be victims of criminal activities. At the same time, I can argue against the statement by pointing out the funds the US must provide for a good quality life for its inhabitants. (Despite a good amount of illegal immigrants not paying proper taxes via the IRS.) All these issues can be solved if people with differing opinions and sympathies learned to compromise and come to a workable solution about the allocations of funds and practices, instead of trying to win all the time. The sheer polarity of people’s opinions in modern politics makes that impossible. For example, this Christmas Eve, Governor Greg Abbot sent 50 immigrants (including children and babies), seeking legal asylum from El Paso to Vice President Kamala Harris’ house as a political statement of his Republican ideologies. Bear in mind that these 50 people did not have knowledge of where they were going, nor the proper clothing to ward off the DC temperatures. This man was allotted $3 billion for border security in the 22-23 cycle. A mature discussion about every single problem regarding immigration, which itself is a complex myriad of issues, and providing each with an apt solution is not possible when the people in power prefer to treat these real life people as pawns they can treat any way they want.

5,1,Vishnu Kulkarni ,"The definition of Feminism, to its core, is standing by the idea of Social, financial and political equality for women. Unfortunately, to day, this idea hasn't seen light. The right to vote, equal pay and social stigma are hurdles the female demographic has been battling forever. Men are looked onto as the bread-winners, the warriors and the head of the house while women, as the calm and nurturing figures to children. Expected to look after the household after marriage, a little girl is forced to put up with all the necessary tasks around the house and is never given the opportunity to truly explore interests. Let alone interests, girls aren't even given access to basic education for that matter, the reason being that their parents don't find it a necessity. This is where my views come in. I feel that after having gone through so much of bifurcation in power and work, being denied equality and where men forced women to take care of house work(cooking gardening etc.), embracing that culture would come in as a false sense of justification to ourselves. This was an oriental man's most powerful form of control over who belongs where and it is just now that we have slowly started breaking free from the control. At the end of the day, empowering is only when a woman gets to do only what she truly, from her heart, wants to do. Be it going out for work or taking care of her children at home.

Any human would want a better life filled with happiness. This also holds true for the people of Mexico. To them, the United States stands for hope, happiness and overall a better life for their future generations. Mexico, according to them, being one of the most unsafe countries in the world, would fail at providing their children a good and healthy life. Lack of basic of healthcare, education and standard of living(at least compared to their neighbor) force them to take these measures. Even thought they are at the brink of destitute, they somehow manage to gather enough wherewithal to pay the illegal immigrant smugglers who ask huge amounts to get the work done. Why won't the Mexicans just get in legally you may ask? This question gets us the other side of the border. The Americans. It is estimated that about 90% of all narcotics entering the United States is exclusively through the border they share with Mexico. Moreover, the citizens felt 
 that they were losing out on opportunities in their homeland which led to some harsh measure being taken against the huge influx of Mexicans into the country, where, getting a visa became increasingly difficult. The only other way, well , crossing borders illegally. Slowly, even that became a difficult task as border monitoring increased 4 fold. Consequently the border became this cul-de-sac for immigrants wishing to cross the border but unable to, while those who got caught on the other side where either deported or held in refugee camps. All this only because a certain group of people wanted a better life for their children. The solution? In my opinion, the United States should first put this issue forward on an international scale and ask Mexico to improve its judicial, medical and educational system. Possibly even lend a helping hand by funding their institutions, instead of building taller walls. This way the people of Mexico wont feel unsafe in their country and won't find themselves in front of a border smuggler.",False

are not given what they deserve. This has resulted in creation of a new faction of people who fight 
for the so called women's rights. These are feminists, fighting to create an equal space for women, where there is no difference. It is true that there are differences between men and women, but these differences have been in existance for a multitude of reasons like the psyiological difference between bodies of men and women and also because of the societal structure that has evolved over time. It is  basically an asymmetry that exists, but there is an asymmetry in all sorts of places, that does not  mean that the society is male dominated. Is there any right that men enjoy exclusively, that women  don't? There is none. But you might say that a vast majority of wealth is owned by men and women do  more unpaid labour and that women are not compensated proportionately. Well, this is applicable to a  very very tiny proportion of men. Huge proportion of people who are seriously disaffected are men. Most people in prison are men. Most people on streets are men. Most victims of violent crimes are men. Most  of the dangerous, life threatening jobs are done by men. Most of the men are lonely, they've got no one  to talk to, they are depressed...when a girl is depressed everyone offers sympathy, but change the gender  and no one bats an eye. Most people who commit suicide are men. Most people who die in wars are men. Most  people who do worse in school are men. Where is the dominance here? Why not fight for equality in these  spheres too. What you are doing is taking a tiny substrata of hyper successful men and using that to  represent the entire structure of the society. There's nothing about that, it's vaguely inappropriate. What exists here is an asymmetry, but it does not mean that the society is male dominated, even if it has a patriarchal structure to some extent, the fundamental basis of that structure is not power, it's  competence; that's how our societal structure. It is just that men stepped up to provide when the need arose and not like that we have roving bands of tyrannical men forcing you to make that choice; it is only that the person who can offer that service best, comes forward. It is not a consequence of being dominated by
anything that is tyrannical and then again our culture is by no means perfect and certainly has some  tyrannical elements but it becomes no ground to state that there is inequality between men and women.

force in 2021, overthrowing the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 
The takeover was widely criticized by the international community, and no countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the new regime, despite nominally maintaining relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban has aggressively campaigned for international recognition since the takeover. Several countries have vowed never to recognize the Islamic Emirate, and others have said they will do so only if human rights are respected. Some countries have accredited Taliban diplomats at the chargé d'affaires level despite not recognizing the Islamic Emirate. The United Nations should however not recognize the Taliban Government as it is one which has been formed after overtaking a previously democratically elected government. Also, the Taliban has come up with a set of rules according to their sect which are pretty oppressing. These rules simply undermine the basic rights of the citizens to which they are entitled. Also, India has maintained a neutral stand on the issue considering the fact that it can unnecessarily cause unrest on the western borders.

46,0,Nikhil Kumar ," feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering because managing domestic activity is not a small thing like lets us understand the importance of domestic activity such as cooking like what we cook that we eat, what we eat, what we become, according to what we become, that much we can do in our life so these activities decide our heights in life, so these domestic activities have a great impact of on us which shapes us in a way so managing these activities in a better way is extremely important because that will decide how an individual be and how the society build so whoever nicely manage this, we should bow down to them, so I think doing these activities will empower us because managing these activities need high EQ and IQ which develop us and empower us as a human being.thank you","As we know the annexation done by the Taliban of Afghanistan is very cruel & creating political instability for the afghan people as well as in the Asia continent, now the Taliban want to admin the country so they want recognition from an international authority like the UN, so before we discuss UN should recognize Taliban or not, First know a bit about Taliban,
Taliban is an organization that is based on the religious idea and it is made by some nations for their interest, Taliban did terror attacks on India like the 'Kandahar highjack', and also create instability in the region, now let see some key points about Taliban:-

1) Taliban does not support women's education also they have strict rules, on how women should be dressed, speak, work, and live.
2) Taliban is so a radical organization they didn't support other religions and in their administration other than the Taliban's religion, other religions suffer a lot of problems like conversion of religion, killing, rape, etc.
3)Taliban have also a history of rule in Afghanistan in which they kill a lot of people because of their superstitious laws, corruption & insensitivity toward human beings.

So keeping these pointers in mind I think recognizing the Taliban is like giving milk to a snake and from a snake, I remember a famous quote by Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton “You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors. You know, eventually, those snakes are going to turn on whoever has them in the backyard.” 
so it doesn't make sense to support that organization which always creates terror and instability in the world because of this The UN should not recognize the Taliban.

5,1,Vivek kumar upadhyay,"Feminst is a person who talk about women equality and being a feminist we should always talk about domestic activities (like gardening,cooking)not only for women but also for men.
Women should not actively reclaim for
Domestic activities they have equal rights to participate in education, society, economics and politics.they should also get chance for higher education.
If we reclaim or encourage women for domestic activities only their can't be Their all round development . Such as sense of self growth and  right to have to determine 
Choice , access of opportunity and resources, power to control their own life
Both within and outside the society and also to express their views in the society.
One important aspect of women empowerment is education Is must for every woman bcz by using this tool 
They can improve their Skills, self confidence and all round development.
By all these things that we mentioned above we conclude that women should not

46,0,Aryan Pal,"I think that this answer lies in the fact that evolution helped the two sexes grow differently. Men who chose to hunt developed muscles and strategies, females who chose to cook and maintain developed observation and management. Feminists who believe that gardening, cooking, washing are tasks that belittle the pride of females and are not empowering should understand that this is what the earlier females chose and they knew very well knew that these tasks are important and are as prestigious as hunting because to maintain is as much essential as to provide in fact you cannot provide for long if you don't preserve. Forget females, males who live without there family prefer doing the household chores by themselves and they understand that it's important, I actually believe that patronizing the facts that males started doing household chores in lockdown is foolishness of the multitude , because men have been doing such things long before that. I agree that women in this era are equally capable as men to excel in any field but the refusal to perform some very necessary daily chores that are necessary for you own proper functioning because of some flawed thinking that they hurt your self-esteem is utter naive.","People from Mexico have been migrating into USA in the hope for a better life for a long time now and this has led to rise in illegal activities such as rise of drug and Arm lords and hence the US govt. chose to close their borders for them with limited admittance of the immigrants, but this has led to piling of large groups of people on the border of USA and Mexico who are now forced to live miserably without roof to cover their heads. No one can be put to blame here because US govt. has every right to work against criminal activities and take any action necessary to curb such practices, and the people of Mexico too have every right to aspire for a better life and take their course according to it, but both parties must also understand that they should respect each others ideas too. Mexican should strive to work in the betterment of their own motherland instead of escaping it and the Mexican govt. must help them in every way possible, in turn USA on Humanitarian grounds should provide Mexican govt. with both arms and financial means.

The main cause of this is the increased unemployment rate in Mexico or one could say the difference of lifestyle in the two countries, causing an influx of immigrants. This increased twofold during the COVID-19 and Trump – Biden Transition. Although , the implementation of Title 42 (we can simplify it as lockdown) caused a equilibrium state, but now as COVID-19 was nearing its end, it was decided to lift this rule and the borders felt an increased  rate of immigrates, along with increased crimes and illegal immigration. The current state of immigrants cannot be explained in few words, as winter is approaching, daily necessities such as bathing, eating, sleeping are far fetched ideas. Their dreams include providing for their young ones, or sleeping in a warm bed.
This has caused an increased crime rates near borders such as illegal immigrations, drugs, human trafficking and so on. The Biden government has reduced the crime rates but its nowhere near to a stop.
This also disrupts the proper functioning of both the countries in many ways:
1.	Assimilation of Mexicans into American communities has been problematic. Many Mexicans can’t speak fluent .This can, in turn, create tension between migrants and locals which can, in extreme cases, lead to segregation, crime and violence.
2.	Mexican migrants often take low paying, menial jobs, which, while low paying, offer higher wages than what they would earn in Mexico. This was,  advantageous, as many Americans did not want these low paying jobs but companies needed people to fill these jobs. Now, as unemployment rises in America, Americans want these menial jobs but many migrants already have taken the jobs. This can lead to increased social tension as Americans believe that their jobs are being taken.
The million backlogs in immigration court cannot be solved unilaterally by any side. The Mexican Government  REMAIN IN MEXICO policy failed miserably also.both counties agree to bilateral talks for their own people, only then they would be able to control this situation. PEACE!!!!",False
5,1,Adithyan S,"Feminism is fundamentally about men and women getting equal opportunities and equal rights. But now feminism has lost it’s meaning. Modern feminism is geared towards the reversal of gender roles. Most women want to be the bread winner and men want to be the soft & caring one. Women now think that doing household chores like taking care of children, cooking, cleaning, etc. makes them anti feminists or make them look weak. Now, even if a woman “wants” to be a housewife, she is looked down upon by other women for not wanting to be like men. She is criticised by other women for not being a feminist. If a woman wants to take care of her children & stay home, she is pressured into leaving her kids to go to work due to the pressure from her female friends. Feminism is about freedom, it doesn’t mean that only working women are relevant or powerful and housewives are weak or at the bottom of the food chain. 
Men & women should be treated equally but that doesn’t mean that they are equal. There are some things in which men are better than women and vice versa. For example, women are more loving & caring, better at multi-tasking, more organised, etc. . And similarly, men are stronger, emotionally more stable, better suited to work longer hours, and make tough decisions. This does not mean that men can’t be good care givers or women can’t be good leaders. Imagine a family, where the mother is the bread winner and the father takes care of the house. The children from such families will not be able to properly function in society, they will always feel insecure because they didn’t get the love they needed which only a mother could provide and they didn’t have a strong leader figure which only a father could provide. We should realise that ""evolutionarily"", the primary role of a woman is giving birth and taking care of her children and the primary role of a man is to protect his family & work to make their life better. So women should not feel that staying at home and taking care of her children and doing household chores is degrading. They should feel proud, as they are helping to make the society better, since children are the future generation.

The reason why women feel doing household chores is degrading, is because how women were treated in the past. They were under-appreciated and were always taken for granted. So now they feel that if they start taking care of the house, women will lose their hard earned rights. But this is not the case, as in the past, there were not many job opportunities for women, so taking care of money, properties and others were mainly dealt by men. This automatically, made men to have more power, hence a patriarchal society. But now, women have many job opportunities thanks to the internet & computer revolution. They should not feel inferior for doing household chores. 
Taking care of the house doesn’t mean that women can’t do other things like following their passion. They can still pursue what they want. Women should be encouraged to take care of their house and their children for the mental well being of the children. Children are the future generation, we should do our best to make them competent members of the society. Women should feel proud and empowered for doing domestic activities.","Taliban took over Afghanistan and the US withdrew their forces. The Taliban are an extremely backward and an islamic fundamentalist group. They aim to bring order into Afghanistan, as they believe that their people have been brainwashed due to the US invasion. They want to make a country where Islam is the law. Those who don’t follow the rules in Sharia are met with strict punishments. They think that they are doing things as Allah intended to. Women have lost their freedom. They are forced to stay inside. Women in Afghanistan feel hopeless. Taliban has banned all sources of entertainment like tv, music etc.. Even under such horrible conditions, some people are still in favour of the taliban. They feel that after 20 years of war, they are at peace. Earlier in the presence of US troops, they were always under a state of panic due to the war between us & taliban.

After the taliban took over afghanistan, many countries have cut ties with them. As a result, taliban has lost supplies of food and other resources. More than 90% of the population are starving and there are no proper medical facilities available for the sick. If the UN doesn’t recogonise Taliban as a government soon, other countries will not trade their goods with taliban and the people won’t get basic resources for their survival. Many people will die due to starvation & lack of health care facilities. The taliban have no past experience of ruling a country, their government is still in its infancy state, by the time they have settled their internal affairs and made proper relations with foreign countries, it will be too late. And sending an army to storm out taliban will cause even more deaths & take more time which again causes a lot of death.
So even if the rule under taliban is horrible and women have lost their freedom, the UN should recognise it as a nation atleast for the time being as saving lives has higher priority. The world can decide the best course of action after the lives of the people are improved and not in danger.",False

For real equality, unpaid domestic work needs to be legitimised and given due recognition.
Domestic activities refers to all work required to maintain the household– from chores such as grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning, to taking care of the children, sick and elderly within the family. In rural areas, this also includes daily tasks such as collecting firewood and water. Managing these daily tasks is not just physical, but also mental and emotional activity. And since it is not considered real work, it is devalued by the men who benefit from it, and the women who themselves engage in it. Although women’s inclusion into the workforce is considered to be a sign of empowerment, it leaves them with a double burden. They have to handle work responsibilities in addition to their unpaid/devalued domestic work.
Therefore, feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. This will in return have an economic benefit. The value of unpaid domestic and care work done by women is estimated to be 13% of the global GDP. But in India, the value is a whopping 39% of its current GDP. This means that a major chunk of India’s productive potential is not even included in its monetary calculation.
Women empowerment cannot be just about increasing pay for women, or increasing their participation in the workforce, but about redefining the current patriarchal definition of work. This will un-gender domestic and care work, minimising women’s work and improving their quality of life. For real equality, domestic work needs to be legitimised and given due recognition. Only then can we expect equal participation in the workforce, and in the household by all genders.
","The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, twenty years after their ouster by U.S. troops.Since regaining control, the Taliban have taken actions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the late 1990s. The Taliban threaten Afghans’ civil and political rights enshrined in the constitution created by the U.S.-backed government. The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations. The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down. Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared. Women have seen their rights obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working. The rate of child marriage has also increased. Moreover, international observers remain concerned that the Taliban support terrorist organisations, particularly al-Qaeda, posing a threat to regional and international security. Under the Taliban’s rule, Afghanistan could become a safe haven for terrorists capable of launching attacks against the United States and its allies. Therefore, it would right not to recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as it poses a threat to world peace and to the people of Afghanistan itself.",False

Hence feminism does not find it good to idealise a particular job with societal acceptances. Appropriate to say, be it a man or woman doing any work is by choice and should be supported instead of any outside insistence or force.We then end up being in a great democracy.","The annexation by Taliban  has imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts.The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down.Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared.Many Western countries, including the United States, shut down their diplomatic offices in Afghanistan after the Taliban took over. They have refused to recognize and establish diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, which calls the country the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.In addition, the UN General Assembly has indefinitely postponed a vote on who can represent Afghanistan at the United Nations. 
Moreover, international observers remain concerned that the Taliban support terrorist organizations, particularly al-Qaeda, posing a threat to regional and international security. Hence whether in regard as a country or with world Afghanistan has now been under a question of security.Thus providing it power and recognition would result in misuse of power by the taliban that ultimately would affect the entire world authorities.So UN must not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as this could be a little form of encouragement for them thats is certainly not good and justified.",False

5,1,Shivam narula ,"I think the world now we are living in has slowly shifted their views and thoughts about women’s rights and values in our society. Whether in a field of defense or science their contribution has been utmost with less discrimination as compared to old times with patriarchal norms. This change in the gradual mindset of people was something to earn, and I think feminists have a huge role in that. Women empowerment movements, active campaigning, and protesting for equal rights and laws have always been their motive which at some point was necessary and needed but over time has become somewhat extreme to a degree they always have to prove to make women feel empowered.
Now, as the title says I don’t think actively participating in domestic activities would make feminists feel empowered. Granted, I understand that most domestic activities are done by women specifically in rural areas, but it doesn’t need to be proven to make it seem bad. Not everything needs to be sold as empowering to women which are not, this just makes women look weak and dependent. It doesn’t matter if the domestic work is being done by a male or female, everyone must perform and no one is obliged to work against their interests as long as they are satisfied with their lives. This does not make one a bad feminist who is being taken advantage of and used as a maid. Different people can take different roles in the household and that's not inherently unfeminist, you can be a feminist housewife. There can also be many sorts of reasons why women may take the role of the housewife and do domestic work, maybe even voluntarily, putting the feminist agenda for doing domestic work to make them feel empowered just adds a negative view of both genders on this and take this too extreme.
In the end, I just want to say, all human beings are born with equal rights BUT all human beings are not equal, and nor we should make them so, we all have different strengths and abilities, interests, etc. The idea this gender should have that way of living is destructive 
","It's almost one year since the Taliban’s ascent to power in afghanistan , but the plight of afghans is worsening. The economic situation is dire, malnutrition rates are increasing, women’s rights are being curtailed there is continuing migration and internal displacement and the health care system is crumbling plus the already high maternal mortality rates are thought to increase rapidly.
We can say that in today’s world every nation is run by an authority with powerful people and modern warfare but it can’t be a proper government without no recognition of human rights . 
I think leading up to all this UN should not recognise the islamic emirate of taliban . The world body must send a strong message to not remember the Taliban’s de facto authorities without respect for human rights including for women , girls and other minorities. 
The main issue for not UN not considering afghanistan an islamic state is that their so called government are nothing more than terrorist organisations that ultimately pose a great threat to regional and international security. Under the taliban’s rule , afghanistan could become a safe haven for terrorists capable of launching attacks against the United States its allies and other powerful nations . 
The taliban inherited what was at best already a weak state . Afghanistan economy has always been on life support. Their crippling sanctions against the senior taliban leaders have paralysed the banking sector and further prevented afghanistan from engaging with the international financial system and its institutions , civilian government is unable to pay salaries even to the reduced number of remaining personnel and to make matters worse their agriculture sector has been affected by drought and natural disasters such as floods and june 2022 earthquake .
I think all the points being stated above more or less proves that the taliban economically, politically, financially and based on basic human rights fails to make a running government . If the alleged rifts and apparent schisms among taliban intensify, it is doubtful that even a transition to a more inclusive government will ever take place ",False

In my opinion, this is not completely right. If a woman is cooking, she is not being pulled back by the society. We see so many working women, who are doing great in their field, yet they manage to do all the household chores themselves. Moreover, there are women who have made their career out of these domestic activities. Further, 80-90 % of people in cooking industry are men. They are well paid and respected. But if our moms, who have done the same thing their entire life without a holiday,  they are not given the respect they deserve.

5,1,Kinshuk Kumar,"“Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" 

I, Kinshuk Kumar, would like to speak for the motion. Feminism in simple words mean that there should be no discrimination on the basis of gender. As Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev puts it “What you have in your pants should matter only in bedrooms and bathrooms”, it should not matter if you’re a man or woman, work is work, but then why are we talking about empowering household chores or gardening. The answer lies in public psychology, we as humans do not want to do something which is looked down upon or considered meagre by the society. It is particularly important to tell people that household chores are no joke, it takes enormous efforts. Sensible humans or people who believe in equality of gender should reclaim the fact that someone has to do household work as well in order for other members of the house to do other work. Household work is full time unpaid labour, it’s like salt in food we tend to take its presence for granted. If we as a society are able to re empower domestic activities then gender would no longer be associated with work. It’s simple, if two people live together and one manages for finance the other should look after domestic work. Domestic activity is equally important and empowering. There should ideally be no hierarchy associated with work, every kind of work has its unique usage and someone has to do it. We should feel empowered while doing domestic activities as we’re still not stuck stereotypical idea of work. 

 ","Should UN recognise Islamic Emirate of Taliban is a question of double standards and hypocrisy of BIG BAD BOYS sitting on UNSC.

Let’s not go into the seeds that were sown in cold war and how two powers destroyed nations just for the sake of proving their ideology right. Democracy is foreign to these lands and we cannot expect same quality of life as in Europe, but what can be done is negotiation. No country is ready to put boots on the ground and local population is not motivated for a revolution, it means that Taliban is not going anywhere. Taliban also knows that it cannot survive without trade and international relations, so they are eager to join UN. Now UN can negotiate with Taliban on basic human rights and ask them to mend their ways. Gender equality is still an issue in well developed countries like Saudi Arabia, still we can argue for education and basic human rights like music and clothing. So according to me, UN should recognise Islamic Emirate of Taliban if and only if they agree to the terms put forward. Taliban has to agree to the terms as their survival depends on international trade, they do not have any other source of income. ",False
5,1,Chinmay Gupta,"I believe that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. In my opinion, gender equality should start from the household itself. It is high time we break free from the shackles of gender defined roles. It shouldnt be the onus of women to undertake household chores but at the same time, undertaking household work shouldnt be viewed as unfeministic.

Popularised feminist discourse has devalued daily cooking and implicitly defined it as work that reinforces women’s second-class status. If a woman genuinely enjoys cooking and gardening what is the harm. Being a feminist doesn’t mean you have to forgo the home making arts. Just because you feel that women are equal to men and deserve equal treatment doesn’t mean you can’t engage in, and enjoy cooking.

Cooking is ultimately a life skill, but it is a refined art form too.  Cooking presents the opportunity to anchor the mind and focus attention on the senses tuning them into sights, smells, sounds and textures of the culinary tasks at hand.
Cooking develops confidence, mental focus and an ability to create and present which is linked to a deeper relationship with yourself. This can help deal with many life situations.
Therefore, men and women, both need to view cooking and their time in the kitchen as a way to deal with life.

Cooking and cleaning are basic skills everyone should learn. In this busy world, we should devote ourselves to being self-sufficient.
Being clean and hygienic is a basic necessity, and there is no gender role for that. The recent scenario which COVID-19 presented emphasises the above point.

To sum up, household chores shouldnt be gender defined. Women shouldnt be expected to undertake all the household duties, along with professional duties. There should be a clear division of labour inside the house.","The UN shouldn't recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. The Taliban now serves as the de facto government, 
doling out punishments and beatings to Afghans who run afoul of the group’s strict Islamic mores.
Yet, in addition to a society and economy on the verge of collapse, Afghanistan could soon descend once again into serving as a safe haven and sanctuary for transnational terrorist groups and violent extremist organizations.

With the Taliban back in power since mid-August of last year, and its Al Qaeda allies getting a new lease on life, the situation in Afghanistan will get worse before it gets better.

The Taliban is an anarchist government. People are devoid of basic human rights. Taliban runs on propaganda, complete media censorship has been established.

Over the past 12 months, human rights violations against women and girls have mounted steadily. 
Despite initial promises that women would be allowed to exercise their rights within Sharia law—including the right to work and to study—the Taliban has systematically excluded women and girls from public life.
Women hold no cabinet positions in the de facto administration, which has also abolished the Ministry of Women’s Affairs—effectively eliminating women’s right to political participation. The Taliban has also banned girls from attending school past the sixth grade and barred women from working most jobs outside the home.
Restrictions on women’s movement and bodies continue to escalate. In May, the Taliban decreed that women must cover their faces in public and instructed them to remain in their homes except in cases of necessity. Women are banned from travelling long distances without a male chaperone, and unchaperoned women are increasingly being denied access to essential services.
Afghan women are forced back into the dark ages. As long as the taliban regime continues, their role will be limited to giving birth and undertaking household chores. 
This simply cannot be allowed. The recent protest by male Afghan students is praiseworthy and similar acts should take place to oppose the anarchist regime.
The patriarchal mindset of the Taliban regime is horrifying to say the least.

Last year, the visuals of people clinging on the wings of an aeroplane to escape were heart wrenching. Times like these make us realise how invaluable freedom is.
Taliban is enclosing Afghans in the walls of their cruelty. Taliban regime is destroying the fundamental ideas of humanity. The UN should publicly oppose Taliban at the very least,

3,0,Sachin,"I am against the motion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. If by considering domestic activities as their only work, women can be empowered then the condition of women shouldn't be this much worse as it is today. Today, when women empowerment and feminism is ubiquitous then we are thinking about reclaiming household activities as empowering, but we never ever thought these activities to be done by men as their work since so many centuries. How funny is it that the works which we never thought that they should also be done by men, today we are discussing about claiming them as empowering. 
We all know that for a person's all-round development and to experience new and amazing things in life one has to leave the boundary of his/her house. They have to enter in professional world where they can communicate with a lot of smart people and can become a person with a vision and goal in life. Here I am not saying that women shouldn't do any domestic work, I just want to say that women shouldn't consider domestic works as their only purpose of life. 
Let us take an example about this. There is one lady who is less educated and doesn't have any big aim in her life and just spend her whole day in doing household works while on the other hand there is a lady like Indira Nooyi.
What do you think about the mindset and thought process of these two ladies? I myself belong from a small village in Haryana where I have met so many less educated women and men also. To be straightforward, I don't know about the reasons why they remained less educated and are just spending their lives in doing household activities, but one thing is clear that their attitude isn't really of that level that they can make a change in society in any way. 
When we talk about feminism, we think about gender equality and equal opportunities to women as their male counterparts. Such type of big changes don't come on their own. To change the mindset of whole society, to change the old societal norms we need a group of people with fiery determination.
Now consider if you are conducting a very important meeting of national importance. Then what type of people would you like to include in that meeting, a person like Indira Nooyi or a person who is less educated and who doesn't have that impressive attitude which is required for making a change in this society? I strongly believe that the type of attitude and mindset that is required for making a change in society can only come when a person faces some type of pain and obstacles during his/her journey. Just by doing domestic works throughout the whole life, one would never be able to be a different person. If women would just do household works throughout their whole life then they will just spend their life as it is going and if we really want a society where all women are getting equal respect and rights as their male counterparts, they have to be educated, they have to come out of their house and should participate in various professional works and only by this they would be able to give a different shape to lives of millions of other women.
","The US-Mexico border problem isn't a problem which rose recently. USA, Mexico, central America and Columbia are suffering from this problem since 1970s. Poor living conditions, violence, drug trafficking and very few employment opportunities have been forcing people from central America (Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) and Mexico to migrate to US since 1970s. 
Right now, as we all know that immigrants are staying at streets whole day and night during such severe cold wave along with their families. They left their homeland in a hope that they would be able to provide a better livelihood to their children and would be able to do some job if they would somehow be able to reach USA. Everyone on this planet have the right to live happily but the situations with USA are also critical. How can USA permit so many immigrants? Would it not hamper their economy? Would it not affect the social structure of USA? 
To get a clear view about this problem let us firstly see that from where did this illegal immigration start.
Since several decades, USA is considered as a nation of immigrants. The reason to this is USA's prosperity, better lifestyle and job opportunities which attracts migrants here. From 1970 to 1990, Mexico suffered a lot of problems like terrible earthquake, currency change, oil crisis etc. because of which their economy shattered a lot. There was violence in Mexico during these years and people started to migrate to US for better livelihood and job opportunities. During those times, it was very much easy to enter in USA because there weren't any proper border laws and USA didn't have any strong control over its southern borders. In 1994, Mexico entered NAFTA and their economy started to improve. NAFTA helped Mexico in industrialization and Mexico's economy was no longer dependent only on oil. Within a decade Mexico's economy improved a lot and people stopped migrating to USA and even several came back to their homeland.
But the people from central America and Columbia are still trying to reach USA through Mexico because conditions there are extremely worse.
It is extremely difficult for a less skilled person to get citizenship of USA. That's why these people use illegal tactics to enter USA. According to a study did in 2006, since 1994 around 10,000 immigrants have lost their lives during crossing the border and these illegal immigration tactics give rise to sexual assaults and human trafficking too. These illegal practices are also increasing the risk of terrorist attack on the US soil. Evidences have been established that terrorist regimes such as Taliban are using the US/Mexican illicit drug trafficking problem to fund their terrorist activities.
This problem is affecting both the nations very much. USA is suffering both economically and socially. Every year US spends millions of dollars in patrolling across borders and to provide shelter to asylum seekers. Because of so much immigrant population, USA have a fear of losing its own culture and traditions. Many low skilled illegal immigrants are proving as a burden to their economy. They are getting more governmental benefits than the tax they pay, and it creates 'net fiscal burden' on native taxpayers of USA.

As this problem is giving rise to several other problems, it's highly necessary to find solutions to it.
The countries, whose people are leaving their own homeland must try to maintain peace and they have to provide better livelihood to their people and must create job opportunities so that people are not forced to leave their homeland.
USA must also take strict actions to prevent this illegal immigration because simply they can't provide space to every asylum seeker.
In order to properly address the US illegal immigrant problem, four area of concern must be addressed.
1.USA must ensure that the help and relief funds that they give to these nations should be properly used so that the economy of these nations can be improved, and people can live with peace at their homeland. This is a proactive measure which should be taken as soon as possible so that they can eliminate the problem completely before the problem overtake them.
2. Priority no. 2 is to eliminate the 'Pull factor' namely illegal employment opportunities which draws immigrants to America and forces them to enter the country illegally.
3. The government must close the physical routes that make crossing into USA.
4.The government must take necessary steps to reduce the economic impact associated with illegal immigration. The fines for companies knowingly hiring illegally immigrant people should be significantly increased. This plan would greatly reduce the attraction of illegal jobs for both employer and illegal immigrants.

USA itself is a champion in providing basic human rights to everyone and an ardent supporter of asylum seekers. They have to make a strong system to identify those persons who are genuinely seeking asylum, so that the needy ones can get help.

Otherwise, by allowing uncontrollable migration from Mexico and abroad, USA risks its own country's national identity, social structure, economy and future viability.

5,1,Vasu Sharma,"I would like to voice my opinion against the motion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. For a long time it has been believed that the society is governed by the men , and women have often been considered as to be the weaker gender. This belief has often been contested against by the women's rights group or the feminists. Household chores like cooking, washing , gardening have for long been considered as a women's job which yield very less income and restrict the financial independence of a women . In order for the society to grow , feminists have been demanding greater participation of women in society and decision making processes so as to make women an equal contributor in the progress of the human race .Unless women are given access to quality education and opportunities in the fields dominated by men like science and politics , they can't influence the society about their demands and aspirations .Jobs like cooking, gardening etc can't be considered empowering for a women as these limit their creativity and promote the orthodox beliefs in the society. Today women have started realizing their potential outside of their traditional household responsibilities and have overcome the large deficit between them and the men in terms of contribution in society and respect in professional lives.","I am not of the view that the Taliban regime should be given international recognition .They have no basis of ruling over the country of Afghanistan as they stormed to power just on the basis of muscle power. We as citizens of this world can't accept the inhumane behavior of the Taliban militia towards women , who have been living a life of fear and constant oppression in the form of policies of the Taliban government. The sole aim of the Taliban government in Afghanistan is to promote religious extremism and rule on the basis of them being protector of Islam. They have repeatedly misleaded the world about their ideology and promise of respecting people of various folds of the society .The new Afghan government is headed by the most dreaded and wanted terrorists who have been found involved in terror acts across the globe .Taliban in no way supports the global aim of peace and harmony which the UN stands for and hence doesn't deserve international recognition .Their latest decree of  barring women from universities further consolidates their anti-women agenda and demands strong global response .Afghanistan has been pushed into the deadly trap of war and disease with its economy on the verge of collapse. Despite it's ill condition , the Taliban regime is in no mood to change their policies towards the minorities and improve people's lives in the region. Further more it has been suspected that many global terrorist organizations have moved their bases to Afghanistan which now provides safe haven to such extremists .Unless the Taliban government change their medieval ideology of religious extremism and women's rights , they do not deserve to be recognized and supported by the UN and the world except for providing some humanitarian aid for the citizens of Afghanistan.",False
5,1,Ansh Rajput ,"This is against the notion provided.

I believe there is a lack of representation of women in nearly every sector across the world. From relatively normal jobs like cab driving or food delivery, to the top positions at huge companies and startups, women seem to be a quite something minority. 

While household work like cooking, gardening etc. are work nonetheless and should not be looked down upon, I believe it is critically important for women to engage in different sectors of work. 

Household chores as work are largely unpleasant and challenging to perform and offer little to no work satisfaction, especially in our society, where it’s mostly unappreciated and overlooked. Generally it is considered a duty of a woman, devoid of any choice, in a huge number of households even today.

Working at various jobs provides women with the most important thing: choice. While many would choose to do the household work, which is perfectly alright, many would prefer to at least have a choice in what they do. When given, they would get a sense of purpose that interests and excites them. 

Not to mention, they would be placed in a world where they will be mostly judged on the quality of their work, and will get the deserving recognition and satisfaction along with it. This would lead to an overall increase in self esteem and satisfaction among women  as a whole.

While I’m not looking down on any type of work, I believe what would empower women truly is having the right to choose and the freedom to exercise that choice. Reclaiming household work as empowering might not only give the society an excuse to subtly limit the freedoms of women further, but also use the term empowering for something that, in a majority of cases around the world, might not be empowering at all. 

While a lot of women do benefit from any kind of work done at home itself, the majority still suffer from large gaps between what they would like to pursue and what they are made to do. Reclaiming household work as empowering would not only ignore the primary patriarchal issues that are still deep rooted in our societies, but would use significant energy and motive which could be used to talk about and work on things more important.","Greetings, I’m going to speak against the UN recognising Taliban. 

The UN stands for peace, human rights and harmony. One of its primary objectives is to ensure peace and security amongst as well as within nations. It is known to send peacekeepers to nations under armed conflicts, to promote peace and reduce casualties and hostility. Another extremely important objective of the UN is encouraging and protecting human rights and freedom for all, irrespective of sex, nationality, race and religion. 

All of these pretty much go against everything that the Taliban exercises and believes in. They are known for denial of human rights in Afghanistan, including harsh discrimination against religious minorities and banning of women from school and most jobs. Having come to power in 2021 by overthrowing the existing government, the have been internationally condemned for violence against the country’s citizens and their hostile and discriminatory beliefs  and practices. 

Standing against peace, freedom and everything else the UN believes in, the Taliban clearly should not attain international recognition.

But this notion is not based on morality alone, rather it has a number of pragmatic reasons as well.

If an entity is not recognised internationally by the UN and other nations, it can lead to loss of: 
1. International cooperation 
2. International privileges and immunities
3. Protection against sanctions

International cooperation consists of legal, financial and against foreign aggression. This will make it harder for the nation to take loans from international banks, will affect trade, the nation won’t be able to take matters to international courts, and the nation would not get aid in case of foreign attack.

A number of international privileges such as treaties, unions with other nations will be affected. The citizens of that nation would not get visa for travelling and the nation would be denied embassies in other nations.

And finally, in case of uncivil and hostile practices within the nation, such as violence against minorities and discrimination against women, international organisations such as banks or the UN itself can impose financial sanctions on the nation.

Further the nation would find it challenging to exclusively govern its own territory, exploit its natural resources and deal with state property abroad.

Thus not recognising Taliban in the UN can lead to the above and put international pressure on them which can work in the interest of the people of the nation.

5,1,Virat Gutpa,"What exactly is feminism? Merriam-Webster describes feminism as the ""belief in, and advocacy of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes expressed especially through organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests."" Feminism started as a movement for overturning legal inequalities, particularly addressing issues of women's suffrage. Present-day feminism focuses on equal pay and equal opportunities for all.

Feminism has become a broad topic, and it no longer focuses on a particular issue or solution. From person to person, the idea of feminism and how to strive for it varies.

For example, in several countries, not necessarily underdeveloped, household chores are seen as ""women's work"", while earning money is seen as ""men's work."" Since ""women's work"" does not generate money, it remains undervalued.

By continuously fighting for equal opportunities in men-dominated public spheres, a wrong notion that ""men's work"" or ""earning money"" should be given more preference to domestic activities is set. While it would be wrong to believe that a particular gender is more suited to certain activities, it is also wrong to disrespect other kinds of work.

By taking up domestic work, the value of household activities like gardening, cooking, laundry, etc., can be raised. The mindset that activities like cooking are less important than earning money can be changed.

While it may never be possible to grant equal opportunities to all, by taking up domestic work, we can ensure that everyone is respected equally in the public sphere, irrespective of the kind of work they do.","The US-Mexico immigration problem dates back to the late 19th century. Since the 1970s, both democrats and republicans have drafted several policies on how to address the issue of immigration. However, these policies have yet to prove effective, mostly because they do not address the root cause of the issue.

Immigrants flee their home country to escape violence, poverty and lack of basic amenities, to find opportunity and safety in the United States of America.

The rise of illegal immigrants leads to increased illegal activities like drug smuggling, human trafficking, and money laundering, which often prey on vulnerable immigrants and exploit their desperation and willingness to take risks to reach their destination. In the United States of America, illegal immigrants have long been associated with criminal activities and are thus subject to scorn and disdain. Illegal immigration also strains resources in the affected countries and increases international tensions.

There is no definite solution to such a complex problem. Nevertheless, we can take certain measures like providing economic assistance to Mexico, promoting human rights, and by addressing the drivers of violence, we can attempt to discourage immigration. Also, simplifying legal immigration for students and job seekers by providing safe passage to immigrants can reduce illegal immigration. Increasing Border Security to deter smugglers and Traffickers and protect immigrants will be helpful.

Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering because these activities have often been traditionally associated with women and have been used to define and limit their roles in society. By actively embracing and valuing domestic activities, feminists can challenge and subvert these limiting gender roles and stereotypes. Additionally, engaging in domestic activities can be personally empowering and can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. These activities can also be a source of relaxation and self-care, which can be especially important for women who may face added stress due to discrimination and marginalization.","It is not appropriate for me to make a recommendation on whether or not the United Nations (UN) should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, as this is a complex and sensitive political issue that requires careful consideration of a variety of factors.

The group has been accused of human rights abuses, including the suppression of women's rights and the persecution of religious minorities. The Taliban has also been linked to international terrorism.

In order for the UN to recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, it would need to determine that the group is a legitimate and stable government with the ability to provide for the needs and rights of its citizens.

In almost all sociocultural environments across the globe, labour has been segmented into breadwinning and caregiving which primarily reinforces gender stereotypes. Sociologists have also suggested how within the gender spectrum, stereotypes are often a reflection of our socio-cultural environment and are perceived as the shared beliefs about the generalised characteristics of males and females. What we cease to realise is that sex is a biological fact and gender is a result of social construction. Therefore, people do not have any innate psychological or social differences between them, but it is the society that attaches stereotypes and roles guised as gender. 

However, before discussing the attributes that constitute a woman’s social role, it is imperative to note its origin. Before we shifted to sedentarisation, the nomadic society encompassed clear sexual demarcation between men and women by assigning different tasks to them. Furthermore, even structural functionalists suggest that gender roles were developed during the pre-industrial era wherein domestic responsibilities were ascribed to females, and bread-winning activities were assigned to men. Sure, these roles might have been functional in the era they were birthed, but they kept passing on to generations and what we observe in the 21st century today, causes dysfunction more than regulation. Therefore, even though the world became industrialised, our society remained stereotyped. ","        "" US-Mexico Border Situation ""
It may seem ironic, but even as it carried out the cruelest anti-migration policies in decades, the Trump administration presided over the largest flows of migration at the U.S.-Mexico border since the mid-2000s.
This continued through Donald Trump’s last months in office, which saw migration rise sharply even as stringent pandemic measures made the pursuit of asylum impossible. This shows the futility of declaring war on asylum, and the inevitability of large migration flows at a time of overlapping security, economic, political, public health, and climate crises.
The jump in migration of Trump’s final months continued accelerating during Joe Biden’s first two months in office. This is happening even as Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) keeps in place , a probably illegal Trump-era pandemic provision that expels most migrants within hours, regardless of their protection needs.

Common factors can include armed conflict, disaster exposure, gender inequality, lack of job opportunities, political corruption, and lack of access to competent healthcare and education. In simple terms, push factors are negative reasons that prompt individuals to leave.

This stereotype can be harmful and contribute to the gender pay gap, as well as to the devaluation of women's labor and contributions. Some feminists argue that reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can help challenge and dismantle these harmful stereotypes and the systems of oppression they reinforce. By valuing and celebrating domestic labor, feminists can push back against the notion that it is less important or valuable than other types of work, and work to create a more equitable society where all forms of labor are respected and valued. This can involve actively choosing to engage in domestic activities, as well as advocating for policies and societal changes that recognize and support the value of domestic labor.","It is not appropriate for me to make a recommendation about whether or not the United Nations should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by some governments and international organizations, and has been criticized for its treatment of women and girls, including its strict interpretation of Islamic law and its restrictions on women's rights and freedoms.

Ultimately, the decision to recognize the Taliban or any other government should be based on a thorough evaluation of the situation on the ground and the potential consequences of recognition.

5,1,Ananya singh,"I believe feminist should reclaim domestic activities as empowering because household work helps in the overall growth of both men and women. According to some research it shows that children who are actively engaged in household activities tend to be more responsible. It helps to children to get better idea about managing group tasks . Corona taught us that activities such as cooking, cleaning and other household tasks are basic requirements of any human being. We all know how hard it was for people who couldn't do household and were dependent on outside for basic things like food during corona. Household activities also helps us to get a healthy body. Being able to do household work ourselves helps us to become less dependent on the society and makes us independent in its own way. There are many women and men who do household work for other people and make money out of it which contradicts the old age definition of domestic work as having 'no value '. If feminist actively reclaim domestic work as empowering it will help people in the longer run as people in the society will not look down on people who stays at home and manage the house and look up on people who do office work. Everyone will be treated equally which will help in futher strengthening of the country and then the world.

Recent laws are suppressing the laws which favoured travelling of women, their education and their basic laws. They are using religious doctrine to get legitimacy from its citizens. Which is using other's faith for their own advantage. Taliban is taking arbitrary actions towards to terrorize people. Which is leading to lack of faith in system and formation of reactionary forces. Some of them are NRF, AFF etc.Taliban is leading to no secularism. It is suppressing the people of other religions by changing laws against their favour or by forcing them in certain ways.

5,1,Prachur Gupta,"I am against the motion:

Not all feminists may feel the same way about reclaiming domestic activities as empowering. While some feminists may find personal empowerment and fulfillment in domestic activities such as gardening and cooking, others may view these activities as oppressive and tied to traditional gender roles that reinforce inequality. Additionally, the idea that domestic activities should be actively reclaimed as empowering for feminists may reinforce the notion that these activities are not inherently valuable or important. Domestic work, including gardening and cooking, should be valued and respected regardless of who is performing it.

Furthermore, the focus on reclaiming domestic activities as empowering may distract from the larger structural issues that contribute to gender inequality, such as the lack of fair pay and opportunities for women in the workforce, and the lack of support for working mothers. Rather than solely focusing on individual actions and choices, feminists should work towards creating a more equitable society that values and supports the contributions of all genders in both domestic and public spheres.

I believe that the feminism movement must refocus itself on the things that matter, and take a smarter approach to solve women's inequality, over the emotional approach. The key is to make society phase out stereotypes completely, rather than fighting stereotypes with counterstereotypes. Such a strategy introduces such ideas to a broader audience, and in doing so propagates them automatically. In the end, more damage is done, despite the good intentions. A gender-blind approach over a pro-female approach is the best way forward, and the only way to ensure true equality.","The US-Mexico border crisis is the biggest threat to the US in terms of homeland security. With the imminent end of the Trump-era title 42 expulsions, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants flocked to the borders and made it across en masse. Many border counties have declared a state of emergency, as they struggle to accommodate the sudden influx of immigrants What’s worse is that the Mexican government itself is encouraging immigrants to cross over. They are even running state-sponsored bus routes to drop them off near the border. They are funding the easy solution of sending their problems off elsewhere instead of dealing with them. Border immigration, while mostly done out of desperation to escape poverty & violence, is also used by the many drug cartels as a vehicle to ship drugs, particularly a newly popular & deadly drug called “fentanyl”. The influx of what may not be the best which Mexico has to offer into a highly developed society means these immigrants do not have the skills to compete in the US labor market beyond hard labor. This leads to a lot of these immigrants choosing a life of crime, boosting crime rates across America. One must also not overlook the humanitarian side of this tragedy. Most people die before they even reach the border, and once they do, they are left at the mercy of charities and local volunteers. 

This has also turned into a massive friction point in American politics, with the opposition Republican Party accusing the ruling Democratic Party of inaction, and “open border policies” which are harming the country. Things have gotten so extreme that the Republican governors of states such as Texas have resorted to taking refugees and bussing them off yet again to Democrat-led states and cities, as well as to the personal residences of prominent Democrat leaders, including the vice president. Again and again, these people are being bussed from place to place, sometimes as rejects, sometimes as political pawns, and sometimes both. This is yet another reminder of the helplessness of their situations.

Unfortunately, despite a great deal of shouting, criticizing & political fighting, no one seems to come up with a valid solution. If one were to ask Trump what the solution would be, he’d suggest a continuous border wall, which is both impractical and ineffective. Think tanks, research institutes, and government-funded studies have all concluded that the only real way to solve this crisis is to improve life for the citizens of the countries which people are fleeing from, which is neither easy nor is it the responsibility of the government of another country. A way to make the situation better would be to make legal avenues for asylum-seeking easier and more inclusive. Such a solution, while technically feasible, would never pass the gridlocked and convoluted US legislative system.",False

A good feminism principals include making the women take her own informed and uncoerced choices. Forced and limited opportunities can't be said empowerment. 
In any society, all the habitants should have to right to make choices about their education and career. 
This very basic principal empowers the female to choose if they want to do the households or pursue other aspects. For a false feminism, domestic activities are still considered as an opposition to women empowerment. But, this is an integral branch of science. Our universities and colleges are providing higher education in the subjects such as 'Home Science' for several years. Hence, yes letting a women choose to look after the household chores is empowerment. 
It is not always correct to match our way of sustenance with the western societies and calling it empowerment. India has a vibrant history where women have participated in wars as well as have served for their families. 
","1.US-Mexico Border: 

The tension dates back to 1980s where the US was doing everything to put an end on the illegal immigrants, and related crimes. Loopholes in the 3100km long border made it easy for the criminals to conveniently carry out all sort of illegal activities. 

The root cause for the precarious condition of immigration in the US-Mexico region are the gaps in the border fences at some locations. The gaps in Arizona have been in talks for being one of the most easy target for defaulters. It was also reported that defaulters across the globe were taking advantages and entering the States from Mexico side. 
In light of this, the enforcement for the immigration from Mexico was made a lengthy process with detailed checking of the immigrants. Vertical barriers were also made.

Besides, the Mexico side has been the entry point to the US for the migrants coming from South America, Greater Antilles or even from Africa. These migrants are in search for a place with security, with economical stability or to elude issues of political violence. This makes the border one of the busiest. For US it becomes a had work to check all those people and then provide asylum for them. Hence, long queues are often found standing near El Paso, Texas even in the extreme weather conditions with no proper housing-eating facilities. 
Recently, migrant arrivals at border has hit the record levels. Moreover, Unauthorised border crossing in El Paso are averaging more than 2400 arrest and detainments per day!
Smuggling of Drugs, guns, substances, human trafficking have been a common issue.

Both the countries will have to construct proper habitat for all the habitats on their lands. Even the temples/churches or schools can participate with the NGOs to provide food to the right migrants. Ignoring their situation will increase threats, crimes in both the countries.",False
3,0,VANSH KAKKAR ,"FOR: 

Across all the waves of feminism from the suffragette movement to the more recent struggle for equality for women at workplace , the  central aim has always been to purge the society (either radically or gradually) of traditional gender norms which tie women to the household and put men in the position of breadwinning for the family. 

Even now there is a significant part of world population, scattered across both developed and developing countries , that can’t bear to associate women doing anything but these “chores”.  

Therefore it’s understandable why in the eyes of equal rights activists, housework such as cooking, gardening , cleaning etc., have always been symbols of male authority, patriarchy and misogyny. 

But this also begs the question whether all day to day tasks involved in every person’s life such as mentioned before, should always be looked at with suspicion and apprehension. 

Should a woman who is involved in all the seemingly mundane duties of taking care of a household be considered oppressed or pitiful. In today’s times such kind of work is not limited to married women or women in general at all. Any person to live truly independently must have basic knowledge of such chores. 

Considering the case for women only; whether you are a housewife taking care of a family , a working mother  juggling your profession and your home, or a single woman living alone ; i believe these tasks don’t make you any less empowered than a man. 

Feminism fundamentally is a concept that calls for equal opportunities and respect for women , freedom for women to pursue their goals and  giving them equal chances as men to rise through the ranks to the top; but it doesn’t and shouldn’t diminish any kind of work,  as long as any person does so according to his/her choice.  

For example,  stay at home fathers or house husbands , some sections of society looks down on them as good-for-nothing unemployed men, unable to provide for their families, but should they apologise for working 24/7 taking care of their children or their spouses, their choice of work shouldn’t make them any less capable than anyone else. 

The same goes for women, and therefore feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering , because every person, irrespective of the gender should take pride in their work. 

 

 ","2)  Today Afghanistan finds itself in almost complete control of Taliban, the same that established and ran the original Islamic Emirate from 1996-2001. 

And the wounds of that reign are still fresh upon the people. An Islamic fundamentalist state, governed under a strict interpretation of sharia law, enforced by an unelected “government” consisting of Pashtun tribal leaders and members of the clergy. A country in which human rights were effectively non-existent, religious minorities were rapidly persecuted, the punishment of petty crimes were often inhumane measures such as chopping off of  arms, or public executions, free speech ,which although was not particularly free in the times before  Taliban, was only there in principle; as journalists were threatened and often assassinated; homosexuality  and other such “behaviour” not conforming to Islam was a crime punishable to death. 

Entertainment activities from television to flying kites were forbidden, and public beatings/floggings were not uncommon for the violators. 

And finally women, representing half  of society, were reduced to second class citizens, forced to cover every inch of themselves in public, always to be accompanied by a male relative outside the home, the Taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges Female employment was restricted to the medical sector, where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls. 

Afghanistan was making gradual advancements since 2001, with the establishment of the 2004 Constitution   which promised equal rights for men and women, general elections and democratic governments(albeit lacking transparency) , more liberal laws regarding minorities etc. Yes,  the so-called elected presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani didn’t exactly represent the rising demand for modernity  in Afghanistan but at the very least they acknowledged the need for the country to stay  a free republic. 

Taliban’s current  rule is the complete antithesis of this idea, a religious hard line reign which has reversed all the advancements women and other marginalized groups made towards equality , in the past decade. 

And with all their power and influence the UNHRC and the Security Council have only been able to express concern for the situation , which , considering the losses US and NATO forces incurred in Afghanistan,  doesn't quite come as a surprise, they are surely apprehensive to interfere again after a 20 year war. 

But the UN recognition of the new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan , under a Taliban which claimed to be reformed last year  , would only put the final nail in the coffin for a severely ailing country, riddled with poverty , persecution, inequality and injustice. It would also strengthen the resolve of a terrorist organization, making it a much more looming threat to the region and subsequently to peace around the world. ",False
46,0,Shivam kumar ," So if we talk about this that feminist  should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering beacause so as we know if we use the  women's labour force in the economic development of the country is minimal. The political sphere of the country is, by and large, reserved for men alone. The place of women in society is also relegated to contributing minimally to the social development of the country. In addition, women's rights are not properly being protected in order for women to participate in various the issues of their country but are subjected to abysmal violations. Moreover, women are highly affected by environmental problems, and less emphasis is given to their participation in protecting the environment. The researcher concluded that unless women are empowered and gender equality is achieved so that women can play their role in economic, social, political, and environmental areas, the country will not achieve sustainable development with the recognition of only men's participation in all these areas. The fact that women constitute half the entire population of the country makes empowering them to be an active part of all development initiatives in the country a compelling circumstance. Hence, this paper calls for the strong commitment of the government to empower women and utilize all the potentials of the country to bring about sustainable development. So this all my opinion that feminist should not participate in domestic work .","The Taliban are a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. 

Following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the original regime in 2001, the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory less than ten years after their ouster. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. The group’s swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.

The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.",False
5,1,Radhacharan,"Feminist is someone who believes in social, economic and political equality of sexes. A man or a woman can also be feminist.

Nowadays the word feminist has been associated with toxic women on social media who blame men for all their sufferings in the world which I believe is not right. Informal association of a word to a radical minority damages its meaning and in the long term hurts the values it stands for.

Yes, I believe feminists (be it a man or a woman) should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. I believe every work be it formal or informal has an equal importance in day-to-day life. In my family, my father is the earning man and my mother is a housewife and that doesn’t take out the importance of domestic activities actively done by my mother every day. My father also helps my mother out in domestic activities because he also understands the importance of it. I also believe switching of roles is also possible in some other family. 

Devaluation of domestic work can damage the morale of millions of people across the world who perform such tasks daily and would be against the very thing feminism stands for that is social and economic equality.
","The reason fundamentalist organisation like Taliban was able to annex Afghanistan was because of corruption and inefficient bureaucracy of officially recognized Afghanistan government still in its infant stage, which was supposed to be kept in check by UN and its member states. 
Now, every day we are seeing news of killings and human rights violations especially against minorities and the women of Afghanistan who are being denied of basic rights like education, freedom to express, freedom to choose what to wear etc. 


Now, in such a scenario an important question arises should UN recognise Islamic emirate of Taliban? Yes, but with heavy sanctions, with official recognition comes the right to demand for monetary aid in the name of development, healthcare etc which can be misused to fund weapons for militia or for the leaders of organisation to funnel into their pockets. There must be diplomatic talks for providing basic human aid like food, water etc for the common Afghan people who are afraid to stand up against atrocities of Taliban. Breaking of all diplomatic links might lead to starvation and death of millions of Afghan people which might lead to a massive humanitarian crisis in the landlocked country. According to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), more than 97% of Afghanistan population will fall below poverty line by mid-2022 compared to 49.4 percent in the year 2020.


Secondly, I believe there should be an immense diplomatic pressure on Islamic emirate of Taliban to withdraw all laws targeting human rights and minorities in the country and make more development-oriented laws rather than religious ones. 


Dealing with Taliban has to be a long-term oriented strategy and is not going to be an easy road for UN and its member states.

And due to the capturing of Afghanistan by USA for over 2 decades And Still USA was not able to stablise the region. Do you think when the highest ranked military in the world could not do anything about that ,then what will we achieve By not recognising them .my take is that rather than revolving around mythical danger We should focus on the main danger And that is terrorism. We should make agreements with the taliban to fight against terrorism and we should be more focusing on the key points like education .because we don't want Afganistan to be same as a backward country always.

I am Vibhuti Minghlani and I'll be writing in favor of the motion, 'feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering'
We are surrounded by a generation of people who love speaking their opinion out, as should they, just the problem is they don't like to act upon it. The so called feminists talking about equal rights and opportunities often lack showing it in their actions, and appear saying lines such as the intro. Well let me clear one thing out for all the fake feminists out there, I am a woman and its not my job to look after your parents, grandparents or children for that matter. The vows of a marriage are taken by both and they are meant to be abided by. The domestic chores are as much a responsibility of a man as of a woman.
Being a feminist, a person should find joy in dividing the tasks and performing them to the best of their ability. Sharing the workload helps create a balance in the house and can be empowering for both the male and female. These are basic skills that both can develop and at the end of the day, you'll feel like you accomplished something just like with any other productive work. It shouldn't be treated like a task, rather enhancing your lifestyle. Sharing responsibility also helps in improving your relationship and establishing a better connection between the two. It also helps in personal growth and teaches you how to multi task. 

At the end I'll just say to all those men who love to be dominating in bed, I guess its time you act the same in your kitchen as well. And for the people who are true feminists and share equal household loads, you are amazing.","I don't think a terrorist group justifies as an efficient government even if they promise to be taking the measures for public welfare, and they should not be given recognition without them providing the basic rights especially for the women of the country.

5,1,Vidhi Balyan ,"English as a language heavily relies on dictionary meanings to catch hold of words that might be misconstrued with their usage in the real world, and as per the OG Oxford Dictionary, a feminist refers to someone who believes in the equality for both men and women. Turns out, the defined characters aren't following the script anymore.
Greetings reader, here I am to provide my insights in support of the above-mentioned motion. Humans are social animals that require a functioning society to thrive in as a race, and common sense with a tinge of biology cements the fact that both the genders (yup, just 2 as the third doesn't participate in population-explosion!) act as the foundation for the abstract and tangible development of the same. But call it over-confidence in our potential or just plain obstinacy, so-called feminists who asked for equality in opportunity are the ones hounding mental peace for their counterparts as well as a major section of other women.
What started as a revolution in the 19th century to reinstate the balance that had been outdone in the medieval era thanks to repetitive colonisations, has now turned into an intimidating cult that believes the path to freedom lies in the metamorphosis into the most toxic variant of the testosterone-carriers, or worse, to defy the intrinsic roles and duties nature has bestowed them with.
Take an example for the same- when a couple welcomes a child into their lives, toxic modernity dictates the father to assist in all chores related to the newborn so that the mother doesn't get burdened by postpartum responsibilities. Sounds fair-&-square, until suggestions come pouring in for the mother to immediately rejoin her job after her maternity leave, stop breastfeeding the infant as it might make her less of the Beyoncé that she is and what not- all at the cost of an innocent child; and insider info- these well-wishers are 99% of the times all women. And if there is a mother who wishes to stay-at-home and focus on her family because she prioritises the same, that lady ends up receiving backlash from all corners (cue: Aishwarya Rai after her daughter's birth). 
The only plausible explanation for these actions would be inferiority complex on the part of such bullies.
If this doesn't suffice, here's another take- it's always expected for the man to pay on dates because the lady is to be treated like a queen, despite the oxymoron of equal pay parity being demanded by the same women.
The point of contention here is pretty simple - if cooking, gardening and other such domestic and supposedly feminine activities acted out by K-drama oppas make women drool, then why the same expectations mirrored at these feminists leads them to fly off the handle?
 The answer is pretty simple- hypocrisy and an ever-increasing greed for attention coupled with ignorance.
All in all, what's required is a balanced approach in tandem with our intellectual aspirations and practical responsibilities to be followed by everyone in unison so that this warped illusion can be nipped in the bud. After all, true feminism is all that we stand for, without the prefixed -pseudo.","An undying belief in one's faith often acts as a milestone in the development of others, but what if these virtues take a U-turn when blinded by the greed of supremacy, oftentimes dictated by faulty religious concepts?
This might've sounded a bit ambiguous, but getting things into perspective, the current situation in Afghanistan is no different. We all remember the ghastly visuals shared from Kabul a few months ago, when the nation was again annexed by the notorious Taliban, leading to people falling-off aircrafts mid-air as the sole way to escape from the clutches of a terrorist organisation that has established itself to be worse than its predecessors.
Now, the Afghan government being overthrown could've been brushed-off as an internal matter, hadn't the Taliban possessed a negative track record of it's doings. But the self-absorbed autocracy negated this option themselves by establishing laws fundamentally anti-humane in nature, that attracted massive backlash from all corners of the world. For reference, the most-recent development was the extremist group denying education to women across the country by pulling the shutter on all its universities operating for women- a big slap in the face of human rights. 
Hence, the question of recognition by organisations like the UN that establish a soft-power on a global scale are automatically negated, being directly counter-productive to what the multi-nation coalition stands for on an intrinsic level. Furthermore, after being tormented by such Islamic extremist groups since decades now, this mobilised public unrest also acts as a significant victory for Afghan people in the bigger combat against terrorism that had earlier sabotaged the security of fundamental human rights for all inhabitants of Afghanistan and further targets of such terrorist activities, India not being very far behind.
Thus, the present stand of the United Nations and all government entities affiliated to it acts as a force to be reckoned with in relation to the constant fight against terrorism and public manipulation in the name of religious fanaticism- acting as a big stepping stone towards a global community centred around the real protection of humanity in the truest sense.",False

5,1,Somay,"Since a long time domestic activities have been performed by women and now it has become an unwritten law for all women. Countless women are still expected to learn and perform housework whether they are earning person or not. This idea that domestic work belongs to women is like a shackle that holds women from achieving their true potential. Young girls are denied education and skills just because the housework is considered more useful for them in life, while boys are exempted from such conditions. The participation of women in indian workforce is very low and many studies have shiwn that the leading cause of it is the extra burden of housework, which women are expected to do along with job.
This does not mean that we should undermine the importance of housework. Cooking, cleaning and other activities are basic activities for survival, therefore women alone should not bear the burden of it. But still in the modern society still, while men are exempted from such expectations women face them everyday.
The idea that domestic activities can be considered as empowering is not only wrong but may also harm the little progress that has been made in improving the conditions. Empowerment does not come from considering old systems and practices as empowering. Real empowerment comes from challanging the existing status quo. It comes from revolting against the oppressive system. Empowerment will come when girls would be given education instead of forced to learn housework. Working women will feel empowered when domestic work is not imposed on them but rather their struggles are acknowledged. When men also participate in the housework and consider it not as favor but as a duty. The modern society will suffer a defeat if it still clutches to its old ideas and values.","Afghanistan has recently gone through some major political changes. The failure of U.S.A. to fight taliban and the subsequent annexation by taliban has led to a messy and confusing situation. People and ministers are fleeing from country and those who are left are uncertain what the future holds. In this situation one question still lingers, should U.N recognize the The Islamic emirate of Taliban. I think the answer to that question is yes, but with some conditions.
We have seen what the Taliban has done to the people of Afghanistan in the past. Denying basic rights to women, human rights violations on non muslims, destruction of culturally significant sites. Despite their recent statements that they are going to change and not fall back to their old ways, the reality offers a different picture. Taliban recently denied girls education in schools as well as universities. Only god knows what they have planned for future. In such situations one might think that U.N must not recognize Taliban, but such decision might not hurt taliban much than it will hurt the people of Afghanistan. Not having a dialogue with Taliban will not stop them from enforcing their will. The U.N must negotiate with the Taliban on offering the recognition if they fulfill certain conditions. We have already seen what forcefully trying to stop Taliban has done to to Afghanistan. The 20 years war by U.S.A has left Taliban stronger than ever and Afghanistan in far worse position. Now it is more difficult to fight Taliban than ever.
Since Taliban is a new government it still lacks many resources for developing its already weakened economy. While they have reprehensible views on women rights, as a government they still want to make Afghanistan a respectable nation. The U.N can offer them recognition and amenities in exchange for prevention of human rights violations. While this will take time and resources but this is the best option we have right now. The failure of U.S.A. has taught us that violence and force will only lead to more problems to the citizens of Afghanistan who are biggest victim in this situation. ",False

The new taliban government is ineffective as it cannot control the coercive machinery of the state and has proven to be uneffective when it comes to maintaining law and order. Recognizing taliban means providing them with a huge platform to share extremist thoughts , allowing countries like china (with veto power) to easily exploit the situation in its favour which is not favorable both for india as well as world because it makes the geopolitical situation bipolar. Additionally taliban regime is not elected democratically nor does it have system to train and assign roles to good and effective leaders. Unstability and human rights issues are bound to prevail unless the government is elected democratically . Also there have been minor resistance movements in panjshir which questions the sovereignty of the state.

As we know china has been using veto power against india by protecting terrorists like masood azhar, how can we be sure that more of such things won't happen if taliban is recognized.  Recognizing taliban will make Afghanistan the hub of Islamic terrorism which can make the indian subcontinent highly unstable and dangerous.",False
5,1,Aayushi Jain,"I would like to write in the favour of the motion “Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering”

All domestic activities including cooking, cleaning, gardening are skills that every adult should learn be it a man or a woman. Just like learning to drive or getting a job is an important task and therefore there is no reason why anyone would  consider these tasks anti feminist.

Feminism simply means the equality of both men and women. It does not mean to degrade any work or occupation and as long as the domestic activities are equally shared among the male and the female members of the house, feminism exists in that house.

Cooking, gardening and other domestic activities is also an art and one should learn all these activities to make them independent. Capability to perform these tasks empower us and we become more confident in life. As a bachelor too, It feels good to save money by making your own food, taking care of your own home, understanding your own basic finances.

Nowadays, the people living in urban areas have become too much dependent on external help. Without help, they feel paralysed. During the covid times, people realised the importance of having domestic skills as outside help was no longer available. It was the time where everyone in the house was compelled to perform domestic activities. 

In USA more than 60% of the parents confessed they feel pressed for time and are not confident enough to prepare meals on their own that they will like, compared to the dinners that come in a box. Consuming pre processed meals everyday has lead to child obesity and has now become a serious health problem in the country. But situations like these can be avoided if all of us learn, share and perform domestic activities including cooking, cleaning, gardening for a harmonious life.

The skills of cooking, hosting guests and decorating houses have also been adopted as a profession by many for their livelihood and some of the people have become very successful in life as hotel managers, chefs and interior decorators. This proves that learning domestic activities is also empowering people.

Therefore in my opinion I strongly recommend all of us to take up domestic activities as a work of pride and empowerment.

I believe that UN should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

Taliban is known to commit a wide range of human rights violations against former government officials and armed forces, including illegal killings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and ill-treatment. Taliban in the name of religion has performed various acts of terror including supporting the dreaded Osama Bin Laden. Taliban in the past has been harassing the citizens of Afghanistan specially the women by not allowing them the basic rights of education, liberty, freedom of speech etc. 

Taliban has been trying to get a seat in the UN by declaring a lot of things including that because it has control over all the borders of Afghanistan and has formed the government of people, it deserves International recognition by the UN.

However, there are two issues with the above claim. Firstly, controlling the borders of a country is not sufficient for international recognition in the UN. The government must follow the conditions of effective control, popular support ,domestic legitimacy and the ability and willingness to fulfil international obligations. Secondly the Taliban government has no sign of any internal legitimacy at all. 

The Taliban government has even faced strong waves of protests and resistance from its citizens. It is difficult for us to even remember the clips that showed lakhs of people rushing towards the airport, climbing on the aeroplanes the very moment people heard the news of Taliban taking over Afghanistan.

If USA and other countries in the UN do recognise Taliban, it would challenge the important principles of the international law and would also lead to serious domestic and international consequences. It would undermine the rights of the Afghanistan citizens and Taliban government’s inhuman regulations will continue to exploit them. It would also encourage terrorist organisations to topple other countries’ governments and seize control over them.

Therefore in my opinion, UN should never recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban till it is widely accepted by the people of Afghanistan and they change their way of thinking and treating its citizens in a fair and justified manner. ",False
46,0,Paras Jain,"Feminism is a social and political movement that advocates for the rights of women on the grounds of equality of both the genders. It does not deny the biological differences between the sexes but demands equality in opportunities. It covers everything from social and political to economic arenas. In fact feminist campaigns have been a crucial part of history in women empowerment. The feminist campaigns of the twentieth century made the right to vote, public property, work and education possible.The feminist approach requires supporting the voice, agency and empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity and others who face discrimination or marginalization.Feminism has had a life-changing impact on everyone, especially women. If we look at history, we see that it is what gave women the right to vote. It was no small feat but was achieved successfully by women.Further, if we look at modern feminism, we see how feminism involves in life-altering campaigns. For instance, campaigns that support the abortion of unwanted pregnancy and reproductive rights allow women to have freedom of choice.From my point of view feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering because it is a way of supporting equal treatment for both the genders.Activities should be dependent according to sciences of the body but it is a way to represent an equal treatment .There were several activities where female were thought to lack in but now they are excelling and are even better than man.By normalizing the domestic activities it would help them to empower in one way or the another.","The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, twenty years after their return by U.S. troops. Under their harsh rule, they have cracked down on women’s rights and neglected basic services. he Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from a non functional group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities. The Taliban threaten Afghans’ civil and political rights enshrined in the constitution created by the U.S.-backed government. Since regaining control, the Taliban have taken actions for their brutal rule in the late 1990s. The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations. The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down . Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared. The Taliban also reestablished their Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which under previous Taliban rule enforced prohibitions on behavior deemed un-Islamic.. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working. Various  reports shows a drastic increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male and to completely cover their bodies. The rates of child marriage have also increased. According to me the UN should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as it would be also motivates and uplifts other terriorist group accross the globe for the action as on Afghanistan.

5,1,Avinash choudhary ,"I thik the  ideology of feminism is that men and women should have equal rights, equal social status and equal opportunities and to me this ideology has no relation with domestic activities. The term domestic activities to me means work you do to have a proper environment around yourself and this has no relation with idea of feminism , it's the very basic things one need to do to get a decent lifestyle. Just because some ladies think that making them do this work is undermining their potential and is exploitation of their rights then they need to rethink what is their potential even amounting to that it can be reduced just by doing housework what their right amounts to if it can be taken away just because they do some household work .
I belive we need to remove this very thought that housework is less important and only women can do it , i strongly believe their is no such thing as gender specific work but each work is important in itself and yes men can also do housework if they like to do it and same goes for women . Thus for empowerment of any gender we first have to respect the choices of the person if he or she  doesn't like a type of work find a way to share that work among your friends or family instead of crying over the fact that why is it me doing all the work 

","Smuggling of migrants is a global concern which is troubling many countries especially so in case of us-mexico borders, Due to the high economic disparities between both countries.Smugglers take advantage of this very fact as many large number of migrants are willing to take risks in search of a better life when they cannot access legal channels of migration thus making them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Their safety and even their lives are often put at risk: they may suffocate in containers, perish in deserts or drown at sea while being smuggled by profit-seeking criminals who treat them as goods.we also can't ignore the fact that this immigration leads to increase crime rates in border related areas .in countries of origin families go into debt to pay immigration fees with no guarantee of return of investment whereas in transit countries immigrants are left to be stranded due to limited sources of income ,and just building a wall will never solve this problem. Most of the time States often target migrants, leaving smugglers, and especially organized criminal groups, which are more difficult to apprehend, at large. Instead it should ensure that priority is given to investigating higher-level smugglers and taking due account of aggravating circumstances in the prosecution of cases involving the smuggling of migrants could have a deterrent effect on organized criminal groups.",False
46,0,Vijeta Kumar,"I would like to present my view for the motion that Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.

In this modern era, We all have definitely heard about feminism and what it means to be a feminist but such an empowering word has lost its charm it once used to have. Today's feminism has become a dog fight of genders trying to put each other down to prove their supremacy. Unfortunately, this is not what the initial moto of feminism was. The initial moto was about equality, having equal rights so that no one feels discriminated. This is the true essence of feminism.

I believe that feminism, in the context of having equal rights and everyone's work being valued equally, is a positive thing for the society and I completely support it. Now being equal does not mean that you have to prove that you can do everything that the other gender can do. This is just not possible. A man cannot do everything that a woman can do and a woman cannot perform everything that a man can perform. Men and women are physically different. This is a fact. Nature has designed us that way and I believe that this is a beautiful thing. Nature have given women a beautiful gift of having the right to nurture life in their bodies. Being able to breastfeed the baby in its early days in this vast world. Nature has given this privilege only to women. But many women seem to undervalue their own gift. They feel that cooking, gardening and household work is not making any change in this world. Well, let me tell this to all those who feel this way. Yes, you're making a change, Yes you're feeding the society. Without a supportive family it would be very difficult for the society to function. The world doesn't work by the contribution of a single gender but by a balance of contributions from all genders. 

At the end, I would like to say that all the mothers should be praised for the invaluable work that they do for the family. Having my tiffin ready when I'm about the leave, waking up early in the winters just so that I don't go to college with an empty belly. These are the things that I value a lot and I can't imagine my life without the contribution of my mother in manging the household work.","I would like to share my views on the topic if UN should recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

Annexation of Afghanistan by the Taliban is a tragic event. Rule by a religious group like Taliban is Dictatorship. A dictator form of a government has always worked for the worse. The condition of Afghanistan is worse than it was before. People are feeling unsafe in their homes. Children are scared to go to school. Women are forced to wear hijab and feel unsafe in their own country. Seeing gunman standing at every corner of the street is definitely not a pleasant view. United Nations should definitely not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as doing so would mean accepting Taliban and the sufferings of the common people in the country.

There are viral videos of people desperately trying to escape the country and trying to hang on the wheels of the plane. People are doing such risky thing just to be alive. Military tanks are marching openly on the roads. A country cannot develop in these conditions. If things do not change it would be detrimental for the development of the country. UN should try to make sure that Afghanistan shouldn't become a completely war-torn country. The least UN can do is to not recognize the Taliban Rule. UN should takes steps to make sure that the essential needs of the common people are fulfilled in the country. UN should also try make sure that Taliban doesn't turn into brutality for the people.",False

India continues to be a patriarchy society facing range of issues such as, sexual harassment, domestic violence, the pay gap between men and women, sexual and reproductive rights, honor crimes and female infanticides.
The term Feminism is the belief in social, political and economic equality of the sexes. Often the term is misinterpreted into inferiority of men. But it’s important to understand that it’s about the equality and not the privilege. 
Other persisted misconception regarding feminism is that feminine women cannot be homemakers. The very fact is that feminism emphasizes on the choice of freedom of women to choose their identity. The statement ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering"" is very authentic. The problem arises when a gender gets identified with a specific work. Doing chores from cooking and cleaning to gardening is no gender specific thing. The bane of the womb is not a gender specific thing. Also, Feminist women don’t deter from being homemakers. It’s an issue when their work goes unrecognized. They say she cannot run elections, as her place belongs to the scullery walls. But its time that she knows her rights to live and learn.
Yes, women and men should actively do household work as empowering. Yes, domestic chores continue to be regarded as unproductive and inferior. But pucker up, we should be encouraging each other, so everyone can thrive, rest, work and feel empowered!","The Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan has been once again conquered by Taliban. Well, the graveyard of empires is a sobriquet often associated with Afghanistan. This is because the country has been invaded earlier by many superpower countries including British, Soviet Union and USA.
Even though, Taliban promised safe passage for foreign nationals, equal rights for women and commitment to battling terror. They look very unlikely to be executed. It would be very ignoramus for the countries to fall for such promises. We have seen public execution, trials without evidence, strict laws for women and revenge attacks on west. The list of banned items and religiously prosecuting people in the greed of power is endless. Danish Siddique killed by Taliban in the lands of Afghanistan is another example. Moreover, the annexation has left the country in economic and humanitarian crisis.
Countries giving recognition to Taliban have been only looking for trade opportunities or deep state politics in Afghanistan. But the most important aspect is peace and security in central Asia. A diplomatic recognition by United Nations would invite terrorism and violation of human rights. In addition, Taliban’s legal status need international obligation which in no way have been fulfilled.
It’s important that we support civilians of Afghanistan who are victims under the tyranny of Taliban’s rule. We need to support the human rights and freedom of the common people.

3,0,Anirban De,"For the motion.

The term feminism is still incoherent for many feminists or so-called feminists. Girls start seeing reels and illogical feeds and sometimes movies like dangal and Mary-com and think they are feminists. And the result is ""Andrew Tate is a misogynist...blah blah"".
 The term feminists don’t actually only mean 'an advocate of women’s rights on the basis of equality of sexes', it is a wide term and has a lot of meanings and branch meanings.
One example might be - feminists are/should be self-independent.
Self-independent also means doing your own work, you have to eat, so cook and eat, no one else is going to cook for you, if that makes you less of a feminist, then first educate yourself on the right meaning of feminism.
Feminists people want equal rights on the basis of gender. So first of all, works like gardening or cooking or other household jobs have not been assigned to any gender, so these things don't come as 'her' job or 'his', no, it's your job, whoever has to eat, it's your job to cook, doesn't matter if you are a man or woman.
I am not saying it's your job and you should do it, no, someone has to do it, either you, your husband, or any other family member, but participating in that activity doesn't make you less of a feminist, that's your job too, you are a family member and you live in that house too, so it's your duty not towards the society or other people, but the duty to yourself, to participate in household activities.","The answer should be a strict no. Taliban is a terrorist organisation and it shouldn't be recognised by any nation.
Afghan women and girls are treated harshly and have no such thing as women’s rights. They have suspended secondary education for most teenage girls and prevented female staff in certain government departments from returning to their duties. Women, there have to wear burkha 24*7. People there don't have basic rights, they are ruled by fear. Most people there are below the poverty line, and the Taliban is unable to manage the economy. So they are just a bunch of reckless goons who gained power by force. Anything we shouldn't do is recognise them as leaders.
As far Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and UAE have recognised the Taliban. But the UN and other countries haven't, and to cope with the situation and help the miserable people out there, other countries should send representatives on their nation’s behalf to provide help. ",False
5,1,Prachi Singla ,"Albeit feminism is about removing disparities amongst all genders (more specifically those caused due to preconceived notions against women), the introduction of the utilisation of domestic activities as means of empowerment is a solution better fit for a radical-minded society. In a community where the essence of household work already digresses with females in mind, associating the same with the hope that the light of empowerment will be visible is a no-brainer for quicker changes.It is nearly impossible to change every mind and have feminism, or better put, gender equality, embedded without deviating from household work as the primary agenda.
There will not be any significant improvement in women's lives by challenging rights and parity in a sector men do not bother associating with in the first place.
Domestic activities can lead to eventual empowerment, but not at the pace for the next generation to reap benefits wholeheartedly. Bringing about the best-suited changes in our surroundings must be efficient and speedy, if not immediate, to bring about. Demanding equality within typically male-dominated sectors is crucial for women to be seen at par with men.
Progress can then be made to introduce the ideology of equality of all genders, irrespective of the role, since places of position will be accepted to be occupied by not just (majorly) one gender, subsequently leading to every work being accepted as gender-neutral tasks. Only then would it seem plausible to ensure that domestic activities would not be seen as a female-centric occupation.","With the methodology of the government of Afghanistan's annexation by the Taliban not being a legitimate prospect, the United Nations still chooses to ignore the presence of their role as the new administration of the nation. With prolonged silence followed by the sudden departure of the country's President, Mr Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan was left without a leader, leaving the Taliban to officially take control over the nation. The only grounds stated by the UN hold over their claim of the insurgent group, now the new government, is the high rate of human right violation. However, if taken into consideration as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Afghanistan would not be the first country to be a member of this international forum. Before the official takeover in August 2021, there were multiple breaches of human rights in the country, as per organisations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Other member states, such as the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Republic of India and many others, stand with significantly high rates of human rights violations. Thus, Afghanistan should not be held exception, while other nations utilise the opportunity to reap the benefit of the doubt of eventual development. Albeit this should not stand to excuse such infringements for the later future, recognition of the Taliban as the official government can make it easier for the government to inculcate Islamic practices in their constitution while aligning the same with the Geneva Convention, altogether with the help of international organisations.

5,1,Mudit Maheshwari,"Feminists have recognized the importance of challenging and dismantling the societal norms and systems that have instilled gender inequality. An influential aspect of this work is actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering. Traditionally, domestic work such as cooking and cleaning has been assigned to women and seen as less valuable or significant than paid work done by men. Women's domestic work has been devalued, resulting in a pay gap between men and women which leads to a lack of recognition and support. It has also contributed to the widespread acceptance of harmful gender roles and stereotypical thoughts that harm both men and women. The time has come to challenge this convention and recognize the value and importance of domestic work. Domestic work is critical to the functioning of any home, and it is time for it to be recognized as such. By actively reclaiming household activities and labelling them as empowering, feminists can challenge the societal norms that have held us back for so long. This will lead to a society with more equality. Embracing domestic work and all that it holds can also be personally empowering. It allows us to be proud of the work women do and to celebrate the skills and abilities that they bring to the home. It allows us to challenge the societal expectations and stereotypes that have been placed upon women, and to create everyone's own definitions of femininity and success. So let's embrace domestic work and all that it brings. Let's show the world that feminists can and should be proud of the work women do at home. Let's actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering and challenge the norms created by society that have held women back for so long. By working together, we can create a society based on equality and ethics. ","It is important to consider the implications of recognizing the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. This is the name the Taliban use to refer to their government in Afghanistan. The Taliban are a militant group that has a history of human rights abuses and imposing strict and oppressive rules on the Afghan people, particularly women.

The recent change of government in Afghanistan, with the Taliban taking control, raises some serious concerns about the protection of human rights and democracy in the country. The United Nations (UN) is an international organization that is committed to the promotion and protection of human rights, and it is therefore critical to carefully consider whether recognition of the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban aligns with the values upheld by the UN.

It is also critical to consider the potential consequences of recognizing the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. This could legitimize the Taliban's rule and justify their actions, and could discourage efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Afghanistan.

In light of these considerations, it may be appropriate for the UN to refrain from recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Taliban until there is evidence that the group is committed to respecting and protecting human rights, and is willing to work towards building a more democratic and inclusive society in Afghanistan.

The Taliban have a long history of using violence and gunpower to maintain control. Concerns about their ability to govern in a fair and inclusive manner are more than evident. It is essential to ensure that the Afghan people are able to participate in decisions about their own future and that their rights are protected.",Maybe
3,0,Vinay Khatri,"I will be presenting my views for the motion , this has been a long run debate in many houses where women who work as housewife are put through all the hard work and in the last they are told that what they did , she just stayed at home and didn't accomplish anything . The working women and housewife , these are the two terms with which we categorize women . If she is working in a company or a government service , then we thought that yes she is helping in the family . But housewife are considered as good as an unemployed person . The household chores , taking care of the younger ones and the elderly are not even considered as work . So , due to this , even in the women's mind these things have gone like yes , she is not doing any work . She thinks that these are things which a woman is ought to do and is nothing special . But this mindset need to be changed . Those who are employed get 1 or even 2 holidays a week , but housewife they work 24x7 and their weekends are far more tiring than usual days . They should reclaim the household chores as empowering . I believe women and men should have equal rights and opportunities in every sphere of human life. Most conversations about gender equity focus on professional life, and of course that’s essential. Women should earn the same as men, they should get promoted at the same rates, and they should have an equal shot in every sector and for every leadership position. In all this focus on work, however, we sometimes overlook the importance of gender equity at home. How can we talk about gender equality when women are even discriminated in their own houses . How can we talk about doing it and spreading this idea in the whole world . Work as scientifically speaking is the force multiplied by displacement . And in household chores , a lot of force is required and you have to displace through the whole house , meeting every person's requirement and taking care of their belongings . For me, feminism is the principle that people of all genders deserve equal rights, opportunities, and respect. In marriages , it is understood that the household work will be done by the women and men will take the more important thing , that some say , of earning for the family . Even from the childhood , girls are taught how to do the household chores by their mothers constantly repeating the same phrase that you must learn it , these are the basic duty of a women , inculcating a feeling in the younger ones that these household chores are not work but just a basic duty which a women need to accomplish at any cost .","[I didn't have any knowledge in these topics , so I have researched on it , and will refer the sources and then will put my views forth ]
The border, and more broadly how the United States defines its relations with Mexico, directly affects the 12 million people who live within 100 miles of the border. In multiple and very significant ways that have not been acknowledged or understood it will also affect communities all across the United States as well as Mexico. ""The Wall"" : The real costs of a barrier between the United States and Mexico . It may seem ironic, but even as it carried out the cruelest anti-migration policies in decades, the Trump administration presided over the largest flows of migration at the U.S.-Mexico border since the mid-2000s.  The increased numbers of people crossing the border right now is something that border experts have predicted for some time now. The roots of what is happening are in the Trump administration policies that caused massive numbers of people to be stuck on the Mexican side of the border—policies like “Remain in Mexico” (which forced over 70,000 asylum seekers to wait for their U.S. court dates in Mexico border cities) and “metering,” a practice under which U.S. border authorities place severe limits on who is allowed to approach ports of entry and ask for asylum, in violation of U.S. and international law. The southwestern States that share a border with Mexico–Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California -- are put under strain when they must process illegal immigrants caught with illegal drugs. Illegal immigrants arrested for drug smuggling are not deported, rather they are processed through the local criminal justice system. The 1990s saw a remarkable decline in crime rates not only in the U.S. as a whole, but also along the U.S.-Mexico border. Between 1991 and 2000, the median border county crime rate fell 34 percent while the U.S. crime rate fell 30 percent. It is tempting to attribute the steeper decline in border crime to stepped-up border enforcement since over the same period, although the number of illegal immigrant apprehensions rose 121 percent . The story is more complex, however, and requires a closer look at the types of crimes being committed. While the border led the decline in property-related crimes, violent crime rates fell twice as fast in the nation than in the median border county. Is the border becoming relatively more violent? How have immigration and border enforcement played a role in generating these divergent trends? This evidence indicates that current border enforcement policies that cause migrants to cross through remote areas and have increased reliance on smugglers, may underlie some of the correlation between apprehensions and violent crime. Future work should look more carefully into the factors that determine the correlation between immigration policy and conditions on the border such as border crime. ",False
3,0,Priyanshu Baranwal ,"Every feminist should reclaim domestic activities because though people think of it as unrecognised and underappreciated work, but secretly it's very important for the mind, it strengthens the attentive parts of brain and caring parts of heart, both of which are much much needed skills for someone who has taken this responsibility to bring women their rights. Women also need to make sure that they are doing the domestic activities only to an extent that it's for their growth and that they do not become their family's servent.
And for men that identify as feminists should definitely do domestic activities in order to show the women around them that they are supported and will be taken care of whenever needed.
We've often seen in Indian society that women are a bigger threat to women's rights than a man. Example: 1)Expecting grandmothers are more likely to cause female foeticide. And 2) Female viewer shaming a youtuber for not wearing a bra as her breasts are shaking alot while she is cooking. 
If such women learner some empathy and care for others then many of women's rights will be claimed automatically.

5,1,ABHIGYAN BHARDWAJ,"For me, feminism is the principle that people of all genders should deserve equal rights, opportunities and respect , not just women! Today ,I will be talking about why feminists should not just go on a random protest but also should work on how to reclaim domestic activities.
 Nowadays what feminists thinks that women should step up from works like cooking , gardening and other various domestic activities and leave it to men but isn't that quite an opposite of ""EQUALITY"", every job has its own value and people should respect that. What am trying to convey is women should excel themselves in every field , cooking for example can also be taken as a profession . Gordon Ramsay , Vikas Khanna , Wolfgang Puck are all male chefs who opted cooking as a profession and are all thriving in their life , not just male chef but female ones too like Rachael Ray and Giada De Laurentiis are prospering in their career as well.
Now , I would like to tell you about this article which is on a woman entrepreneur whose food business clocked Rs 25 lakh in just 8 months. Lalita who came up with this idea of tiffin service always wanted to be financially independent and used to do tuitions to earn a living. After that, she joined a full-time job a few years ago but quit it ,later on came up with this astonishing idea which helped her a lot in her life. 
Gardening if taken into consideration can also help in plenty of ways , there are lot of sites around the country that rely on gardeners to look after their grounds by doing a range of tasks such as pruning, weeding, and leaf clearing – as well as planting and maintaining trees and plants.
Thus, people can empower themselves even in domestic activities as well , its just the mindset which creates the difference.  In conclusion, there's a clear difference between one who is understanding equality and one who is fighting for a particular gender equality. So, all feminists are requested to empower domestic activities as well because at the end of the day its going to help our society in some way or another.

","The situation going on with the immigrants who are stuck between US-Mexico border is very devastating and needs to be sorted out as quick as possible ,if you guys don't know back in covid days ,Trump’s pandemic-era immigration restrictions locked migrants on both sides of the border in perilous situations which was none other than Title 42 . 
But when everything was going smooth , government decided to lift this rule resulting to a great chaos on border. Can you imagine spending your Christmas night on a street and not with your family? sounds painful right , now think about hundreds of migrants who are camping in the cold at Mexico’s northern border over Christmas, hoping for a swift reversal in restrictions imposed by the United States as they endure the bite of a winter storm ravaging the region. Not just this, border experienced an increment in illegal activities such as crime rate, drug dealing , illegal trespassing. According to an article ,migrants were stopped 227,547 times in September at the U.S. border. Problems which both the countries are facing right now is mainly economic impact - rush on border is resulting to longer wait time of cargo shipping. Research shows that a 10-minute delay in wait time could lead to a loss of  $26 million because even those few minutes reduction in wait times will make up an additional million dollars worth of cargo entering the United States each month. 
Though U.S will be the one facing more problems because Mexican migrants who often take a low paying job which is actually higher than what they would earn in Mexico would no longer work in U.S anymore somehow affecting the growth of economy too.
Possible solutions to this problem are -
1. Providing assistance and stability to communities , backing up them in every way possible, i know its tough but not impossible 
2. Expansion of legal pathways for protection should be done , and some strict action against criminals so that no more crimes and drug dealing happen within the chaos.
3. Coordinated emergency response should be on their priority list , responding to the immigrants problems and dealing with it in the correct way.
4. Rest i would like you guys to help in every way possible as well , we can help them even by here by donating any amount on trusted government sites .

Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering because these activities have historically been used to oppress and discriminate against women. By reclaiming and valuing domestic activities as important and fulfilling, feminists can challenge traditional gender roles and break down the societal expectations that limit women's potential. Additionally, domestic activities such as gardening and cooking can provide a sense of accomplishment and contribute to a sense of self-sufficiency, both of which can be empowering for individuals. These activities are basic life skills . Furthermore, reclaiming domestic activities can also serve as a form of resistance against the capitalist systems that exploit and profit off of women's unpaid labor in the home"," The number of immigrants, including those seeking asylum, who have attempted to cross the border illegally has risen significantly in recent years, leading to overcrowding and often dangerous conditions at detention centers and other facilities.

Illegal activities, including human smuggling and drug trafficking, have also increased along the border, and these illegal activities can have negative impacts on both countries. They can lead to violence, corruption, and other criminal activity, and can also put the lives and well-being of immigrants at risk.

There are a number of possible solutions that could be considered to address the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. One approach would be to focus on addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability, in the countries where many immigrants are coming from. This could involve providing development assistance and support for governance and rule of law.",True
5,1,Pranjal Kumar,"For:
Recent feminist movements have pushed towards the change of women’s economic status.
They focus on the change of women’s jobs from domestic work to higher paying white-collar jobs. While there is nothing wrong with this, the classification of domestic work as menial or at a lower position than white- or blue-collar jobs is just inherently wrong.
Domestic work is a profession as old as time. Even today 75.6 million people work as domestic workers. Growing up, almost every single one of us would have had someone in our house coming to clean, wash and cook. 
The only problem with domestic work is how society views it. It is often lower paid and the people involved in it are those who face an unstable economic situation. However, the solution doesn’t lie in making women move away from these jobs. It lies in making the world realize that there is nothing wrong with these jobs. That these jobs are necessary and are some families’ livestock. Make the world see that there is a woman cleaning 4 houses a day, cooking for 5 families and washing hundreds of clothes a day while suffering from excruciating joint pain only to go back home and cook for her family while her husband lies, drunk and passed out, in a puddle of his own vomit. Let the world realize who wears the pants in that family.
In the end, all that needs to be said is that domestic jobs are not menial. There is no need for women to move away from it. In fact, these jobs should be actively reclaimed, accepted and normalized so that the situation of these workers can be improved. There should be efforts to increase the base pay of these workers so that it is easier for them to support their families. Finally men should be made aware that working as a domestic worker is better than complaining about unemployment with a drink in their hands, squandering away their wives’ hard earned money.

","US - mexico issue:
This topic reminds me of a joke. Why are there so few athletes in Mexico? Because anyone who can run, jump or swim there is already in the United states. 
 The US Mexico border is porous. In the fiscal year of 2022, the US Mexico border authorities encountered over 2 million migrants, some of whom repeatedly tried to cross the border. The border stretches for 2000 miles, making it near impossible to provide strong and complete protection across it, and building a wall is just not the way to go.
What the trump administration failed to realise was that most contraband coming to the US was did not come through illegal ports. It came through legal ports of entry. Hidden in compartments of various vehicles, through maritime routes, commingled with legal goods, or by bribing the authorities. People immigrate hiding in cars, grabbing onto the underside of the buses, risking their lives to enter the states, hoping for a better life.
An integral part of the community of the United states is the non American population comprising of 14.6 percent of the total population. Mexicans comprise about 50% of the immigrant population. They provide rich culture along with a massive workforce to one of the leading global economies of the world. Just removing them and preventing further immigration will just not help the country. What needs to be done is investment in security across the border, preventing drugs, weapons and criminals from entering the country  , and easier passage for those who are persecuted in their own country and wish to seek refuge and live the American dream. America is a country that thrives through its immigrant population and without Mexicans it would not be the same and would most probably be worse off. 
The solution to the immigration crisis lies in the improvement of border security and better opportunities for genuine refugees coming from the southern border.

It is some sort of a myth between people including women, that ""housewives or women who do domestic work are not empowered women"". But housewives, who do domestic chores every day, do the same work as full-time jobs.  Women empowerment is to not just shed light upon women being able to achieve success where men can. And it's not just illustrated by highly qualified, hard-headed, determined women driven by career outside the house. Women empowerment is also when women choose to be a homebody and work for chores all day. It's something not everyone can do. And women should be proud about it. It is definite that women are not ""made"" for this work, like kitchen work, gardening and organizing but they are surely great at it and that's the quality women should be proud about instead of taking it as what people throw at them, being lazy and laid back. It is a proud moment when women choose their own profession and does not let anything define their worth and dignity that is usually being minimized to a job. Due to the backward mindset of older generations which didn’t believe in educating women and only engaging them in household chores has resulted in numerous women not having the technical skills to work in corporates and industries with high profile jobs but by seeing household chores as an empowering entity, women have the opportunity to be proud about themselves and live with dignity. Empowered women, regardless of what they do or be, are women who have freedom to follow their dreams and passion.","On 15th of August 2021 when India was celebrating its 74th independence , the ideals of democracy :justice , liberty , fraternity and equality before the law , another country in our neighborhood saw its 20 years run with these lofty ideals end under a hardline Islamist group who after coming back to power imposed a strict interpretation of sharia law , now the question arises before the U.N. whether the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan should be included in it or not whose principle ideology  is in full conflict with the  very foundations of U.N. so a Clear way to deny legitimacy to this country would be by denying it a membership in U.N. this way it would discourage warring groups in trying to form govt.

5,1,Mahi,"Popularised feminist discourse has devalued daily cooking and implicitly defined it as work that reinforces women’s second-class status. In an era of climate change linked to industrialised foods and disease epidemics caused by the modern Western diet, kitchen work has acquired political importance. Daily cooking must be understood as public, as well as private. 

Neither feminist theorists nor environmental educators have integrated cooking in the kitchen, specifically, into discourse. By examining two local foods activist groups, we measure one site where feminists value cooking, and we develop a feminist theory of gender-inclusivity. Based on our survey, feminists who cook with local foods are only beginning to ideologically integrate feminism and sustainable foods cooking; however, we argue that in practice, the connection is strong and that it is time to conceptualise a new discourse on the kitchen for a feminist-environmental theory of cooking.

The widespread belief in society is that feminism is a philosophy of women hating men. In reality, feminism is a revolutionary political idea that believes in the social, political, and economic equality of all human beings irrespective of their gender. Feminism is concerned with the marginalization of women, being reduced to a secondary position all over the world. It is not a phenomenon of any country or society. Feminism asserts that women’s basic humanness and selfhood are not objects but persons. It also asserts the right of women to know themselves not as a shadow of men but as autonomous and authentic individual.

It works on five basic principles working to increase equality, expanding human choice, eliminating gender stratification, ending sexual violence, and promoting sexual freedom.

They are the ones who carry the weight of the house, care for the family and manage household affairs.

This is the only profession which demands nothing quantitative in return. It demands only love, affection and respect. But we consciously or unconsciously don’t respect this profession.
Housewives add equally to economic growth as any other working profession.

Domestic activities have been perceived by them as regressive and conservative in idea. Feminists also due argue that men too should help with domestic chores and it is only not a woman's job. But, domestic activities cannot be regarded as regressive only by the fact that women were complied to do the same. Doing domestic chores does not make someone old-fashioned and regressive. Things like cooking are a necessary skill for a human being to survive whether being a man or a woman. Domestic activities can be empowering and a full-fledged career can be made in the same too.

Islamic Emirate continues to pose a threat to the global security and the recent uprising of TTP in Pakistan can be seen as a proof of the same. Taliban's extreme form of Sharia implementation has brought the people of the country to starve and struggle for food. Recognition of the UN will give justification to all these unfortunate incidents.

5,1,Gitesh Batra,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, traditional gender roles have unfairly assigned certain activities, such as domestic work, to women, and feminists have long sought to challenge and dismantle these harmful societal expectations. By actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists can challenge the notion that such activities are inherently feminized and therefore less valuable or important. This can involve reframing the narrative around domestic work and seeing it as a form of resistance to traditional gender roles rather than a form of submission to them.

Furthermore, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also involve creating more equitable distribution of domestic labor within relationships and households. This can help to shift the burden of domestic work away from women and allow for a more equal sharing of responsibilities. By valuing domestic work and actively participating in it, feminists can work towards creating more balanced and equal relationships and households.

In addition, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also involve promoting self-sufficiency and independence. For example, learning to garden and grow one's own food can be a way to take control of one's own food security and become less reliant on others. Similarly, cooking and learning about nutrition can help individuals to take charge of their own health and well-being.

Overall, feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering as a way to challenge traditional gender roles, create more equitable distribution of domestic labor, and promote self-sufficiency and independence.","The situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is a complex and challenging one, and it has been a source of great concern and debate in recent years. The rise of illegal activities, such as human trafficking and smuggling, has contributed significantly to this problem, as it has put immigrants in danger and made it more difficult for them to access legal and safe channels of migration.

The impact of illegal activities on both the United States and Mexico has been significant. In the United States, illegal immigration has long been a contentious issue and has been used to justify a range of controversial policies, such as the construction of a border wall and the implementation of harsh enforcement measures. These policies have had negative consequences for immigrants, including the separation of families and the detention of individuals in overcrowded and inhumane conditions.

In Mexico, the situation is equally dire. Many immigrants who pass through the country on their way to the United States are often subjected to abuse and exploitation by smugglers and traffickers, and they also face significant risks due to violence and crime in the region. In addition, Mexico's inability to adequately address the issue of illegal immigration has strained its relations with the United States and has had negative economic and social consequences for both countries.

Possible solutions to the problem of illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border could include improving the legal channels for migration and providing more assistance to immigrants who are seeking to enter the United States legally. This could involve increasing the number of visas available for immigrants, streamlining the application process, and providing more resources for those who are seeking asylum. Other potential solutions might include addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty and violence, and working to promote economic development and stability in the region. Additionally, it will be important to address the issue of smuggling and trafficking and to provide more resources and support to immigrants who are fleeing abuse and persecution. This could involve increasing funding for organizations that work to assist and protect immigrants, and strengthening international cooperation to combat these illegal activities. Overall, finding a solution to the perilous situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border will require a multifaceted and collaborative approach that takes into account the needs and rights of immigrants, as well as the concerns and interests of both the United States and Mexico.",False

Once a person excels in these domestic activities they become inevitable. They can balance life effectively. Feminists are people who follow feminism, they can be both men and women. Hence as domestic activities are equally important for both men and women, they should be practiced by all. Domestic activities should be reclaimed as empowering because these activities are helping women from humble backgrounds to start their own businesses, follow their passion and generate income, thereby giving them opportunity to establish themselves.","I believe the United Nations should not recognise the Islamic Emirates of Taliban, because the rule of Taliban goes against everything that UN stands for. Taliban rule   Denies basic human rights to the people of Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan are not in harmony with the government, if UN recognises Taliban, justice would be denied to the people of Afghanistan. The Taliban rule exploits the right of education and freedom to its people. Women in Afghanistan are merely considered as properties of men. If UN recognises the Taliban State, it might give boost to terrorism and rule by force. Many other countries might also consider it as a validation to exploit human rights. This can endanger democratic rule and jeopardise world peace.",False
5,1,MAHEEM SAINI,"So I will be writing against the motion and the reason for which is, we all have limited and unpredictable amount of time, so all must have that freedom to choose where he or she wants to invest it, hence it is unacceptable to make someone invest his/her valuable time on something predefined also against their will. Simply, what I am trying to say is that everyone must have the right to choose. Now the question comes then who will manage the family and house chores ? So in 2022 - 23 its really simple to answer and some of my suggested ways to solve the problem are, First one is that the  a family must divide the chores amongst each other in a proper manner, where everyone can have right to choose and also everyone is equally involved which prevents the overburdening a single person. Second, If no one is willing to do the house chores then, the family must contribute to keep a housekeeper or a maid. Similar to them there many more ways to solve it. So according to me the above stated statement is against the right to choose, hence I do not approve with it. ","So I will be writing on the situation of Afghanistan, saying about wether UN should recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, a short answer will be NO, because what Taliban did was not the ethical and legitimate way to take over the government and recognising their act will encourage other such groups in the different countries which can lead to a very terrifying situation. But if we see from a different view then not recognising it will make little impact on taliban but will make the innocent people living there suffer more , So I think that the UN have to work out a middle way in which we can sever the basic needs of the people living there by not justifying what Taliban did was acceptable. Such as UN can allow taliban to trade with different countries for the basic needs related to health, food, shelter etc.I really think that it would not be a cake walk to manage this situation for UN.",False
3,0,Rajat Tanwar,"Domestic activities are not limited to cooking and cleaning the house but also includes taking care of children and elders and maintaining the house.

The idea that domestic activities is suppressing for a woman and career (most argued against domestic activities) empowers a woman is completely wrong to me. The thinking that “look a woman over there, quit her job and is now taking care of her children, such a pity” or “look, she is a housewife, so retrograde” is immature. The truth is domestic activities actually empowers a woman as she is being true to her nature and is actively doing her gender role.

I believe domestic activities is an important part of female gender role, It’s one of the innate female desire to have children, to cook delicious food and take care of loved ones, along with maintaining the house of her male complement who provides and protects her. Any woman who has permanently denied this has in the future suffered severe mental illness, and there are several examples in the west of the same.

On the other side feminists who argue that, other people can be hired for domestic activities in their home has also seen to be wrong. Woman who permanently work fail to look after their home and children, and instill family values in them, and this leads to poor upbringing of the next generation of the family as both father and mother are responsible for development of a child, which eventually leads to falling of the society.

Now I am not saying that a woman shouldn’t have a career or a job, as there could be several reasons for it which may include economic problems in the home or maybe there is a great passion for something or the other but when a woman chooses a career over her motherhood/home, she unknowingly denies the purpose of her life, and her biological and emotional needs.
Therefore, I strongly believe that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.
","I think for now the UN should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, as Afghanistan has gone through a lot of blood shed due to the greedy ambitions of majorly USA and Pakistan. Also to state that Taliban and Al-Qaeda group is nothing more than the Mujahideen fighters who were brainwashed by the Pakistani army and ISI (Pakistan’s intelligence agency).

Initially the Soviet and the then president of Afghanistan had friendly ties. After the president’s assassination and political instability in Afghanistan, the Soviet stepped into Afghanistan trying to control the situation. Afghanistan comprised upon the communist idea supporters and people against it (non-communist idea people) commonly stated as mujahideen fighters.

Pakistan saw it as a great opportunity and bribed USA to support the mujahideen fighters, after the States defeat in Vietnam war by the Soviet. The Americans agreed and provided funds and weapons to the fighters through Pakistan. In return Pakistan partially used these resources to take revenge against India after their loss of East Pakistan/Bangladesh.

When the Soviet withdrew from the war, the Pakistani were afraid of withdrawal of US funds, so they turned the mujahideen fighters into Taliban and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups and brainwashed them into fighting against USA

After the 9/11 attack the USA was forced to continue the war against these terrorist groups, whom they initially supported against the Soviet, and therefore the Pakistani army continued to receive the funds.

As I stated above, the Taliban were brainwashed people who were turned into terrorists. They only wished a non-communist government in Afghanistan. Now a change in their behavior is seen, they are regaining sense, and grasping the level of greed of Pakistan army, and I think they should be given a chance to form the Afghan government without any foreign intervention, at least for some time.

46,0,Ronak Gupta,"Domestic workers are often underpaid, overworked, and exploited. They don’t earn fair wages. They have no recourse against their employers when they violate their rights. And many of them even work under illegitimate conditions. This isn’t okay. And it’s time for feminists to stand up and say so Almost all domestic workers are women, and almost half are immigrants. But despite the fact that their struggle is intertwined with and magnified by issues of gender, race, and class, they’re often in the shadows of the feminist movement.
It’s time for us to take up the cause and champion domestic workers’ rights and here are three really important reasons why.In our culture, domestic work is seen as “women’s work"" and domestic workers are part of what is unsurprisingly one of the most gendered career fields in the country. There are currently millions of women employed as domestic workers, and many of those women also live at the intersection of one or more additional oppressions

","let me start with one very simple but profound fact. From day one, Mexican President underscored that he needed to confront organized crime head on and roll it back. The inroads that orga­nized crime had achieved over the past six years in Mexico were such that we suddenly found ourselves in a position where not only had drug trafficking orga­nizations been able to exponentially expand their operations in Mexico, but they also started gaining control of small municipalities of certain corridors of trafficking patterns and routes in Mexico.

A Stopgap Measure

From day one, President Calderón decided to take organized crime head on, and he made a very brave, though sometimes controversial, decision of using the armed forces as a stopgap measure to shut down the drugs flowing through Mexico to the United States. Why stopgap? Because one of the challenges that Mex­ico faces today-and which Mexico has faced a long time-is the corruption that has plagued civilian insti­tutions, especially the police forces and especially at the municipal and state levels. And one of the prob­lems was that, given the President's decision to move in and shut them down, he had to use the army as a stopgap measure.

I say stopgap measure because, for good reason, in the United States you have something called Posse Comitatus-the fact that armed forces should not be put into law enforcement missions makes sense. When you've got $8 billion of bulk cash being trafficked into Mexico across the border from the United States, when in one single operation you can seize $206 million in cash in a safe house in Mexico City-that is the amount of money that is out there corrupting, bribing, paying for killers in the fight against drugs in Mexico.

An institution that has had, so far, a squeaky-clean record in terms of its ability to withstand cor­ruption from organized crime in Mexico is the armed forces. We needed to ensure that the corrup­tion did not penetrate the armed forces in Mexico. So this is why the President is using them as a stop­gap measure, but the intention is to pull them out as quickly as we can and as soon as the civilian police forces are ready to roll.",False

There is a long history of certain domestic activities, such as cooking and gardening, being associated with femininity and assigned to women as their primary responsibilities. This can lead to these activities being devalued and seen as less important or less worthy of respect than activities traditionally associated with men.

However, feminists have argued that all activities, including domestic ones, should be valued and respected regardless of whether they are traditionally associated with men or women. Some feminists have therefore encouraged the reclaiming of domestic activities as a way to challenge and disrupt traditional gender roles and expectations, and to assert the value and importance of these activities.

For example, some feminists have argued that cooking and gardening can be empowering because they provide a sense of accomplishment and pride, and can be a form of self-expression and creativity. They can also be a way to connect with nature and the environment, and to contribute to the well-being of others through the provision of nourishment.

Ultimately, the decision to engage in domestic activities, and how to view them, is a personal one and should be based on individual preferences and values. However, it is important to recognize and challenge any societal biases or expectations that may influence these choices.","The situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is a complex and perilous one, and it has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. Many immigrants, particularly those from Central and South America, have been driven to leave their home countries due to poverty, violence, and political instability, and they have turned to the United States as a place of refuge. However, the process of seeking asylum in the United States can be difficult and often involves crossing the border illegally, which can be dangerous and potentially deadly.

The rise of illegal activities at the border, including human smuggling and drug trafficking, has also contributed to the perilous situation faced by immigrants. These activities often exploit and victimize immigrants, who may be subjected to violence and abuse as they try to make their way across the border. The presence of such illegal activities also undermines the rule of law and can lead to conflict and instability in the region.

One possible solution to the problem of illegal immigration at the border is to address the root causes that drive people to leave their home countries in the first place. This could involve efforts to promote economic development and reduce poverty in Central and South America, as well as addressing issues such as political instability and violence. Additionally, there could be efforts to improve the legal process for seeking asylum in the United States, and to provide more resources and support for immigrants who are seeking refuge in the country. Finally, it may be necessary to work with Mexico and other countries in the region to address the problem of illegal activities at the border, and to improve border security in order to better protect immigrants and reduce the risks they face.",Maybe
5,1,Raghav Singh Jaggi,"“Feminism is not about making women stronger.Women are already strong.It’s about changing the way the world perceived that strength.”In the contemporary world,feminism is thriving on its inclusivity on every demographic.Feminism has become intersectional,taking on the fight for not only women but also identities who are underrepresented.

Taking in reference the topic of the house,I would like to put forth my views against the motion.Women’s empowerment can be defined  as to promoting women’s sense of self worth,their ability to determine their own choices and their right to influence social change for themselves and others.This can be enforced in many ways rather than confining them within four walls.From doing the domestic chores like cooking,cleaning,gardening etc to taking care of the children and the elderly,women carry out at least two and a half times more unpaid household and care work than men.As a result they have less time to engage in paid labour or work longer hours.It is the need of the hour that such work which subsidises the cost of care that sustains families,supports economies and often fills in for the lack of social services is recognised.We must turn over a new leaf by encouraging men and women to split all the unpaid work equally so that they both thrive,rest,work and most importantly feel empowered.Also giving more job opportunities to women can help boost their self-esteem and they are able to work at their full potential.Studies have reported that raising female employment to male levels can directly impact GDP growth rates,increasing it by 34% in some countries.Women can also be uplifted on a regular basis by vocally giving credit to their ideas,ensuring to include their opinions in the conversation before meetings and conferences,prohibiting any sort of discrimination against pregnant women and including them in matters of new projects or promotion without any discrimination and through their participation in politics which results in tangible gains for democracy, including greater responsiveness to citizen needs, increased cooperation across party and ethnic lines, and more sustainable peace.

To conclude I would like to say that a woman’s ability must not be defined by domestic activites and is certainly much more than becoming a good homemaker.In a world full of opportunities,women must not be shackled by such stereotypes as they are powerful drivers of progress when they are free to claim their rights.

","Martin Luther King once said,”Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”In 2021,the Taliban forces fought against the Afghan government and returned to power twenty years after their ouster by US troops.

Taking in reference the topic of the house,I would like to put forth my views against the motion.Since it’s return to power,the Taliban has committed a chain of human rights violations against Afghan officials and armed forces,including extrajudicial killings,arbitary arrests,incommunicado detention and torture and I’ll-treatment.The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic Law.One year after the Taliban’s ascent to power in Afghanistan,the plight of Afghans is worsening and there is no end in sight of their suffering.The economic situation is dire,malnutrition rates are increasing,there is continuing migration and internal displacement and the health care system is crumbling - the already high maternal mortality rates are thought to have increased four-fold.On top of all this,the Taliban have waged war against women’s rights.They have deprived women of livelihood and identity.Afghan women and girls are facing both the collapse of their rights and dreams and risks to their basic survival.The Taliban decreed that women must cover their faces in public and instructed them to remain in their homes except in cases of necessity.Women are banned from travelling long distances without a male chaperone.They have banned girls from middle schools,high schools,universities and barred them from most fields of employment. Women have no cabinet positions in the de facto administration which has also abolished the Ministry of Women’s Affairs,thus effectively eradicating women’s right to political participation.It seems as decades of progress on gender equality and women’s rights have been wiped out in mere months.Despite the atrocities executed by the Taliban over the past year,they have portrayed their government as legitimate in hopes of attracting international recognition and occupying Afghanistan’s seat in the United Nations.

To conclude,I would like to say that a possible recognition of the Taliban by the United Nations and other states would not only undermine some important principles of international law, but it would also have serious domestic and international implications.Also it would internationally embolden other terrorist organizations across the globe to topple governments and then demand international recognition as the legitimate government of the states they’d seized which is a direct threat to world peace.

46,0,Garvit Jawa,"FOR:
I would first like to state the definition of what feminism is ""The advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes."" and feminists are of course those who believe in that ideology or at least that's how it is supposed to be. And apparently in the past women were indeed not given equal rights as men and most women were performing domestic chores while men were out working. But in the present I cannot think of a single right that goes against feminist ideology and yet some don't feel empowered performing domestic activities like cooking, gardening etc. This reminds me of an argument that we were taught in school ""Women are not paid to do domestic chores whereas when men perform the same chores as work they are paid for."" well in the modern world men and women both have equal opportunities and women are paid for if they take on these chores as work. But in some families women still perform domestic activities by choice without any pressure, this does not imply that they are not empowered or are dependent on men, my own mother for example is working and yet she cooks, and she's more than empowered, trust me. At last I would like to say that we live in a modern society where both men and women are equally empowered and are free to do whatever they want with their lives. And that if someone chooses to do domestic chores, nobody has the right to look at them with pity or classify them as ""not empowered"". It's time feminists must actively reclaim such activities as empowering!","The Taliban, which is an Islamic fundamentalist group, started annexing territories after being ousted from Afghanistan by the US in 2001 and in 2021 the Taliban swept right back into power by force. A peace treaty was signed between the Taliban and the US according to which US withdrew it's remaining troops from Afghanistan leaving the government vulnerable and the Taliban took full advantage of it by toppling the government and gaining full control once again. Even after making promises to respect rights of women and various minorities they implemented harsh laws violating human rights. The current government has proved to be unsuccessful in providing enough health facilities and enough economic opportunities to the citizens and the overall economic state of the country has worsened a lot after being taken over by the Taliban. Food insecurity is another huge problem being faced by the citizens, around 90% of the population is facing some kind of food insecurity.

To conclude, I believe that UN should NOT recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban since doing so will only result in promotion of such behaviour in the future and international laws will loose their value.",False
5,1,Divansh Bansal,"I would like to be in favour of the motion. I believe that no job is small or has less importance than the other. The pay of a job can never determine its value. It is its purpose and problem solving efficiency which decides the importance of any work or job. As far as the jobs which are understood to be less important are concerned, even today, work done by women is generally not dealt with respect and honour. Whatever work women do is often disregarded or not given any proper consideration. Whereas if the same task is taken up by a male person, that work becomes respectful and valuable. This is a sad truth that gender, still at times, decides the worth of a work to be done. Therefore, we as a society should try to bring a change. We should step up and take domestic activities in our hands. That is the time when we all would realise the need and importance of domestic work the women of our society do. Feminists are the ones who always support and fight for equality of women in the society. Hence, they should actively reclaim domestic activities and prove that women are truly a blessing to mankind. By doing so, they would empower the women community and help their work gain honour in the society. Feminists should take up activities like cooking, gardening, house cleaning etc. so that they also get the hack of such activities. By this, they would understand the difficulty and pain suffered by women in regularly doing such work. Women never complain about not being able to do such household work. They punctually do their work without any break. We must acknowledge and appreciate their efforts. This would be possible only if we feminists, take the responsibilties in our hands and do their job. Therefore, it is highly essential for us as a part of the society to stand up for women and respect their work. Women empowerment does not only mean to stand and fight for the rights of women, it also means to actively consider their work as our own and reclaim it. That is why feminists should eagerly participate in domestic work and hence take a step towards empowering women.","The recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban was a tragedic thing to witness. It was a traumatising depiction of the power of domination of one over the other. It showed how one dominant country can easily conquer and rule over the other weaker country. It was really unfair and unjust for the population of Afghanistan. Such acts endanger the people of other countries as well. According to me, after this havoc in the nation of Afghanistan, the UN should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. The United Nations is an organisation which is designated for the growth and betterment of humanity. It is like an international guard for the various people living in different nations. Being a responsible organisation of such importance, the UN should carefully look upon the selection of its members. It should have only those countries which are not a threat to mankind. It should make sure that all its members follow a basic protocol of not invading into another country and acquiring its territory. This is because, the UN is responsible towards maintaining the safety of its members and superpowers like Taliban are a real menace for all the countries around the globe. The Islamic Emirate of Taliban does not deserve a place in the UN. It has lost that respect and honour. The act of Taliban community in the country of Afghanistan was not justifiable at all and it needs to be punished at the public level. The UN must boycot such annexations. It should stand against the dominant behaviour of the Taliban community and deny it a place in its organisation. The invasion by Islamic Emirate of Taliban is an example of a sadist culture which should not be acceptable in this time of democracy. Whatever the Taliban did is a betrayal to mankind. It took away the lives of many innocent Afghans. Such acts of violence and suppression should never be promoted. Hence, the UN must not recognise the Taliban and cut off all its ties with them. It would be a right step to not consider the Taliban in the UN because they are dangerous for the government and the people of every other country.",False
46,0,Abhiram Agarwal ,"There are people who believe that we do not need feminism today, but nothing could be further from the truth. Women have struggled for equality and against oppression for centuries, and although some battles have been partly won - such as the right to vote and equal access to education – women are still disproportionally affected by all forms of violence and by discrimination in every aspect of life.

Jokes about feminism and stereotypes about feminists persist, and many of these are also homophobic and assume that being lesbian is something ‘bad’. In fact, being a feminist is not something particular to any sex or gender.

Those who conceptualize power as a resource understand it as a positive social good that is currently unequally distributed. For feminists who understand power in this way, the goal is to redistribute this resource so that women will have power equal to men. 
My proposed account of what demands can do emerges
from feminist debates in the 1970s, which covered a
range of issues about care work, service work, and
domestic labor. Feminist movements initially turned
to the problem of housework as a way of disclosing
women’s oppression in the home. In searching for novel
ways to reject the activities characterized as women’s
natural duties, many used the language of work to
recast them as alienating drudgery and as central to
upholding patriarchal structures Disclosing this work was not only
crucial to understanding the “material basis” of
women’s oppression but also “politically vital” for
“the development of the correct strategy for the
Women’s Movement” It allowed feminists to frame the
home as a site of struggle, and for those seeking a
revolutionary subject beyond the industrial male working class, to center housewives in a revolutionary strategy
While some disaggregated domestic and
reproductive labor  others saw housework as analogous to or inclusive of reproductive labor
performed by secretaries, nurses, teachers, domestic
workers, and sex workers .
WfH activists described the “public reproductive work”
and “socialized housework” women performed in the
service industry, including in “the home in the hospital”","No country has “recognised” the Taliban as Afghanistan’s new government since it took power in August 2021. There has been much speculation about the preconditions and consequences of recognition. One important question is whether and how recognition or non-recognition may affect counter-terrorism efforts.
The conventional approach is that foreign recognition is not legally “constitutive”, or determinative, of whether an entity is the government of a state. Rather, an entity qualifies as the government if it effectively, independently and durably controls the state’s territory, its authority is recognised (but not necessarily supported) by the population, and there is no rival effective authority. Recognition may then simply be “declaratory” of this legal situation; but even in the absence of recognition, the entity will still be the legal government.

This is the case even if the entity came to power unconstitutionally, at least where there is no rival entity with a valid constitutional claim; and even if it is not democratic or does not respect human rights. The essential rationale is that international law abhors a vacuum. To pretend that a government does not exist where a political entity is obviously exercising authority would mean that the entity is not bound by the state’s international obligations or responsible for breaches of them. It would also mean the entity cannot assert the state’s rights, including to protect its people’s interests or defend the state from foreign intervention.

The UN General Assembly deferred any decision on whether the Taliban represented Afghanistan from 1996-2001, despite it ruling most of the country at the time. The difference then was that the Rabbani government maintained its constitutional claim, whereas now there is no rival claimant. The the UN Credentials Committee deferred a decision about the new Taliban administration in December 2021 (alongside Myanmar’s military government). Again, this may indicate displeasure with the Taliban and its shunning by the UN, rather than a denial that it is legally a government. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have withheld funds from Afghanistan on the basis of non-recognition by states – including emergency funds to combat COVID and an economic crisis.",False

Whenever one talks about a strong independent person, what actually does come to one's mind?
Feminism was a movement aiming for equality between the sexes in both law and practice.The movement ,as it began to spread its roots ,started creating this false image in people's minds that the house chores that generally women used to do was of less importance or had less meaning as it didn't actually generate any monetary outcome.This ideology was a bit contrary to the movement's real basis : empowerment. Women were less exposed to educational/financial rights and slowly and steadily as this movement spread, equality began to make its way in the world. In this process ,people started forgetting the real meaning of empowerment,people started depreciating the value of  domestic work . In today's time, sexism has been reduced to a point size but the disregard  for domestic work as empowering ,still persists. A person is entitled only when s/he is  able to do all their daily chores by themselves.
If you can't wash your own dishes,iron your own clothes,make your own food, you will always be less empowered regardless you're a man or a woman.
People dream about material things and earning bunches of money in order to get happy ,little do they know that cleaning and washing chores can actually boost serotonin (and other happiness hormones)levels in one's body so instead of dreaming of ""one day ""why can't we decide to make today ""day one"" and change our habits for the good?

So taking the question again, what comes to one's mind while thinking of a strong ,independent person?

From above, it may look like the people who are illegally migrating are to be blamed but the situation is somewhat twisted here. People want to shift to the United States for better livelihoods but the legal process is too time consuming and impractical that there is no other way around.If a mexican with an american child wants to go to america, the estimated time for their visa to be approved would be around 24 years.
People migrate illegally not because they want to risk their lives but because there's no other practical legal option. This roughly 3000 km border line separates two entirely contrasting economies. People doing small jobs in the usa are seen as kings in terms of money in mexico. The situation is so worse that people take help of smugglers in order to enter the states. The crime rate in mexico has risen to a whole new level, there are so many cartels that penetrate through the border via tunnels  to supply drugs illegally. The cartels are big and powerful and have successfully infiltrated the mexican government. The normal mexico citizen doesnt feel safe in his country anymore and thus they look forward to go to other countries. The  solutions to these problems would be to strengthen the boundary between the two countries and make the immigration system feasible enough that people dont even consider the option of shifting illegally.Mexico should also reform its corrupt justice system and work upon eradicating all these cartels.

46,0,Anu lata,"Women and girls worldwide face many inequities and constraints, often embedded in norms and 
practices and encoded in legal provisions. Some laws, such as those governing access to land, 
include inequitable and exclusionary provisions, thus institutionalizing discrimination. Where 
such legislative measures are not in place, customary rules and practices often have restrictive 
consequences for women limiting their access to key resources such as land and credit, and 
affecting household food security and nutrition. Not only are women and girls affected directly, 
but members of their households and communities are also affected inter- and intra-generationally. 
Women and girls are affected through two main channels. One is the limits on their access to 
education and employment opportunities, which curtails their economic autonomy and weakens 
their bargaining position within the family. Their weakened bargaining position translates into 
little or no voice in household decisions, differential feeding and caregiving practices favoring 
boys and men, food and nutrition insecurity, and lower health and nutrition outcomes. 
Second, the discrimination they face not only exposes women to material deprivation, it also makes 
it more difficult for them to fulfill their vital roles in food production, preparation, processing, 
distribution, and marketing activities. Challenging the constraints women face must therefore 
be treated as a key component in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. Such an approach 
is achievable, it is inexpensive, and it can be highly effective. The cost to society of not acting 
urgently and more decisively will be considerable.
However, more than good intentions are required to remove the inequities and obstacles facing 
women and girls. Nor is amendment of legislation that is gender-discriminatory by itself sufficient. 
Social and cultural norms and the gendered division of roles they impose must be challenged. 
Empowerment of women is required. This means a greater role for women in decision making 
at all levels, including the household, local communities, and national parliaments. Women’s 
empowerment is not only a priority goal in itself but an intrinsic human right, already recognized assuch in pledges and commitments by governments. It is recognized also because it has instrumental 
value and is a condition for society to benefit from the increased contribution of women to food 
security and adequate nutrition. Society urgently needs the full potential of women’s contribution, 
but it can only materialize with wider recognition and acknowledgment—by women and men 
alike—of its benefits to all society, and the vital importance of reshaping social structures..... thank u","The Taliban are a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. 

Following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the original regime in 2001, the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory less than ten years after their ouster. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. The group’s swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.

The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.The Taliban also threaten gains made in Afghans’ standards of living over the two decades after the U.S. invasion. The country’s economic situation has worsened since their takeover, with the United Nations estimating that almost all Afghans could be living in poverty by mid-2022. More than 90 percent [PDF] of the population has been suffering from some form of food insecurity. Exacerbating the crisis is a pause in aid by some countries and international organizations, which had been the lifeline of the economy and public health sector.

Moreover, international observers remain concerned that the Taliban support terrorist organizations, particularly al-Qaeda, posing a threat to regional and international security. The United States invaded Afghanistan after it refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Under the Taliban’s rule, Afghanistan could become a safe haven for terrorists capable of launching attacks against the United States and its allies, experts say, despite Taliban statements that “Afghanistan’s soil will not be used against the security of any other country.” 

In its April 2022 report, the UN team that monitors the Taliban said the group “remains close” with al-Qaeda and that “al-Qaeda has a safe haven under the Taliban and increased freedom of action.” Indeed, in August, a U.S. drone strike killed al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul. Reports suggested that Zawahiri was living in the home of a Taliban aide, and other al-Qaeda leaders are believed to be based in the country. The UN report said that al-Qaeda is likely using Afghanistan as a “friendly environment” to recruit, train, and fundraise, although it is unlikely to launch an international attack before 2023 at the earliest. Following Zawahiri’s killing, a leaked U.S. assessment said that al-Qaeda has not reconstituted its presence in Afghanistan, though some experts disagreed.

For years, the Afghan government depended on assistance from dozens of countries; 75 percent of the government’s public expenditures were covered by grants from international partners, according to a 2019 World Bank report. Many of these countries suspended aid after the Taliban took over, sparking concerns of further economic turmoil. But in 2022, aid picked up, with donors providing over $2 billion by July. Still, UN officials said an additional $2 billion was required by the end of the year to meet the country’s humanitarian need. ",False

But there are some people who misuses the term feminism, and they are usually known as pseudo feminists, they do not believe in equal rights for women they want to do things that are in favour of women even if it cost disrespect of other individuals.

46,0,Yash Mishra,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering. We often come across the prejudices and subjugation that women of every caste, color and creed and have gone through for centuries. It was often believed that and in many parts of the world still believed that household chores like cooking, cleaning and taking care of children was just a woman's task. That is why the movement of empowering women began and was called as Feminism- the fight for equal rights of women, and this culminated in better job opportunities, less subjugation and freedom for women from the notions of century old patriarchy.Neither cooking nor cleaning are ""demeaning"" tasks, they are just tasks that need to get done. The odd comment is when a woman doesn't cook and clean, not when she does most of the cooking and cleaning -- the latter doesn't raise an eyebrow at all. The only problem I have seen is with the gendered expectation of women to cook or clean, even those who don't care for either. A few people make a big deal out of my not cooking *only* because I'm a woman. Regardless of the fact that women may be bringing home the bacon, some people still expect the women to also shoulder all the housekeeping responsibilities and give a free pass to men (who may be contributing less). Tasks would ideally be divided up by the couple according to their interests/liking/how much time each spends at home, etc. not according to their genitalia. It isn't bad for women to cook and clean.

Now talking about about the feminists, they have engraved in the minds of modern people that women should consider joining desk jobs so that they should be placed equal to men. This is no way a bad influence , the bad thing is that play on their minds that household works are small and they are domestic help to their husbands(those who are married).No work is a small work. We have heard some new things in this generation such as househusbands which is like the vice -versa of the thing we all know. This happened due to increase in education and development with time. Due to this, we have seen an increase in women coming out of their shells and going for works or doing something the love. So, the thing is there should not be any person/organization telling a specific part of society what should the do. If someone loves to do cooking , housemaking , and other things they should do that without coming into someone's influence. Nowadays, there is a spark going in Gulf countries about by women about removing hijabs and walking freely in the society. All over the world, we have seen women coming out and speaking about the issues they had been facing and they are also been backed up by the government as well as International organizations. As a conclusion, we can say that feminists should reclaim domestic activities as empowering.
 ","The US has reported a large number of migrants coming from Mexico and some other nearby countries in recent times. Looking into why Mexicans are migrating, it is mostly because they want to better their livelihoods and look for new opportunities.

Just recently, it was in the news that migrants were kicked out from shelters on Christmas Eve and were dropped in front of Kamala Harris'  (the Vice-President of USA), house.

In favour of, 'Feminist should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering'
As said by Diane Mariechild,
						""A woman is full of circle .Within her is the power to create,nurture and transform.""
Whenever the term Feminism or women empowerment pops up, a lucid image of succesful, career driven,financially independent woman  emerge in our minds.Women emerging as new faces of CEOs of company is motivating to tons of girls, who are  dreaming to acheive pinnacle in their journey of life, but a flaw has been seen in this convection of strong woman.We only see career driven woman as empowering and powerful.Nowadays ,every feminist  , young girls worship talks about managing their professional life but only a handful talks about doing domestic activities also as their priority.

Doing domestic activities is not just only our responsibility as human beings but it is  therapeutic to our minds.It gives a sense of accomplishment and peace. Feminist should ignite the fire of being independent in every sector . Woman in the past tried so hard to break the patriarchal barriers, the confinement of domestic boundries but their intentions were never to led down house hold work as obstacles in their successs.Household work is not a gender specific work,doing it  doesn't make one  superior or inferior.Acing your responsibility towards your house is another cherry on the cake.We should not limit the concept of empowerment just to financial world,and Feminist can help in acheiving this goal with right words and platform they have.

Feminist should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.Career driven woman and housewives both are equally hard working,ambitious and powerful.As Michelle Obama once said,
'There is no limit to what we,as women,can accomplish.'
So Feminists should not confine power within the industrious area only.They should empower every sector of work for every gender and see the magic unfolding its wings.


","No, the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. As United Nations proclaim,
                             ""As the world's only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries. ""
They are a global body that represents the views of the majority of countries irrespective of their current state. They hold the power of providing peace, food, and education to every country in the best way possible. If a competent body like theirs will support the annexation of the Taliban on the people of Afghanistan, then who's gonna take a stand for the poor and weak section of society? where will people go to ask for justice?

Acceptance of the UN of the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban will not only give more power to the dominant and oppressive section of societies but also a message that when you have power and money you can have your way no matter how much wrong it can be. Taliban caused chaos in a happily democratic country, they not only dismantled their government but also killed many ministers. They forced the PM of the country to flee and save his own life first. They took many rights of women and are now harassing them and weaker sections of society as per their benefits. Women hold no cabinet positions in the administration, they have effectively eliminated women’s right to political participation. The Taliban has also banned girls from attending school past the sixth grade and barred women from working most jobs outside the home.
""When we are together, everyone here is talking about how the Taliban has destroyed our lives.  They won't let us go to school because they want us to be illiterate like them.""
-- Nasima, 35-year-old Kabul resident

If powerful bodies like the UN will not take action against oppressors and will promote them then the doom of this world is near. That's why they should not accept the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan and should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban.

5,1,Vaishvi,"People have a misconception in their minds regarding the term-feminist. A person being a feminist is not against doing domestic work or someone who's fighting for power. A feminist is a person who wishes to balance equality between the two genders. Many people are claiming to be a feminist without even knowing the appropriate meaning of this term. Women tend to leave all the domestic work stating that they are a feminist. Well be it a man or a woman, doing domestic work won't make you a nonfeminist. Cooking, washing, gardening are some basic daily chores that need to be done regularly but leaving these tasks only for a woman is where the problem these tasks only for a woman is where the problem lies. Morally this is a personal choice but if this is affecting women as a whole, then it needs to be discussed. from the day this world existed are divided amongst men and women as male and female-centric.  Gone are the days when blue was for boys and pink for girls. Similarly, domestic workers should be shared by both partners through mutual understanding. As the statement says 'Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering ' it nowhere states that women should stop working outside and a feminist is not always a woman, a man can also be a feminist. Doing domestic work along with the tasks we love to do is redefining the definition of feminism. Some tasks are a necessity not a choice. If we talk about equality then we need to treat domestic work equally to any other work. Empowerment by setting new and right standards is the need of the hour. Household work is the most basic task in everyone's life but it should not encircle a women's life. Cooperation and Coordination are the two terms with which we can balance domestic tasks by doing justice to every woman in society.","2nd Answer 
'The Taliban’- A name which comes with a lot of negative emotions filled with threat, sorrow and fear in every mind. The question ‘ Should the UN recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban?’ is itself a big mistake. The answer to it is a loud and clear NO. United Nations is an organization that aims to keep all nations United and maintain peace internationally by respecting human rights. How can a government that does not show any indication of fulfilling any of the human rights be given recognition under the UN? It’s a pure disrespect of the agendas of the UN and International law. The biggest fact is that the Taliban is a government imposed by force and not by the general public. Even the civilians of Afghanistan are not happy with the Taliban. Afghanistan has turned into a country posing threat to the lives of people, terrorism is at its peak. Women’s rights, freedom of speech and the constitution, nothing is being respected. Women are not allowed to work or pursue secondary education. The economic condition is drastically going down. The government is not even capable to pay the salaries of their employees. These factors are acting like a cherry on the cake for describing the non-efficiency of the Taliban government. The sole purpose of the Taliban is to use Afghanistan as the hub of terrorists. By making use of their power they are exploiting the civilians. Not only to Afghanistan but they pose a threat to the whole world. Another shocking fact is that the supreme leader of the Taliban has remained so mysterious since the day they captured Afghanistan. The person who has the sole authority is not identifiable. This is so impractical. How can a government be recognized without even knowing who is their main leader? Neither do they have popular support and domestic legitimacy nor do they have the ability and willingness to fulfill international obligations. Their cabinet is an all-male cabinet with all the UN-listed terrorists as their ministers which is the biggest proof of the Taliban not respecting women. Canada, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan have even designated the Taliban as a terrorist organization. Approximately every country refuses to recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. A country where there’s always a risk of life, constant murders, and not being able to raise voices is a threat to the holistic development of children. The young minds will be deeply affected mentally and emotionally. Everyone deserves to enjoy their freedom but in a country ruled by a terrorist group, it is impossible.",False
5,1,Anshuman,"I am going against the motion: ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" First of all, let me drill down to the bedrock of this argument/conundrum and ask, “What is feminism?”. Many will say that feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the gender. But I feel that it’s something more than that. It is an ideology which has an aim to establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.
Since ages and ages, men have considered themselves superior to women and this belief led to the creation of gender discrimination. This further led to a system of belief that women should only manage household/domestic activities and all the other jobs are to be done by men. After the emergence of industries, this hellacious situation worsened, and women started demanding equal rights as men. This is where feminism kicked in with the notion of equality in jobs. Feminism kind of considers that in most of the cases, women perform domestic activities out of compulsion, and not due to any obligation. Women also want to work in the outside world and earn money to live a life of freedom. And, from this point of time, reclaiming domestic activities such as cooking, gardening, washing, etc. will only lead the situation to retrograde in developing and under-developed countries. It will only lead to the fiasco of feminism. Developed countries usually have an educated population which understands the problem of gender discrimination. But that’s not the case in other parts of the world where people’s mindset has still not changed, orthodoxy is prevalent, and families incessantly prevent girls from attaining education.
","What comes in our mind when we hear about Mexico? Drugs, cartels, alcohol, crime, smuggling. This can definitely give a vague idea to a person who is oblivious about the problems which persist in Mexico. And to escape this situation, a large number of Mexicans try to cross the northern borders and get into the United States either legally vis-à-vis asylum, or illegally. And in an attempt to do so, those illegal immigrants get stuck between the US-Mexico border. Thanks to the wall built by Donald Trump, the number of immigrants crossing illegally has significantly reduced. But they still get stuck at borders. Problems don’t end here. The primary issue which has originated is the increase in number of crimes in border areas in the US as well as Mexico. Immigrants usually run out of money and resources and thus start committing crimes to keep their body and soul together. Both the countries are at loss due to this immigration fiasco. Illegal drug trade has significantly increased, and America has suffered the most. Drug addicts are on rise and the economy has started suffering. In Mexico, the situation isn’t any better. It has become a victim of ignominy and its image is deteriorating in the world. Mexico has kind of become the epitome of drugs supplier. Both the countries have got into a hellacious situation which they can’t escape. 
Albeit there are a couple of ways in which this situation can be managed and improved with time. The US can put forward and establish a policy which kind of resonates with that of UK’s Rwanda policy. By this policy, the US can deport asylum seekers to a country/region which has very low population density and high job demand. Another way can be an awareness program among immigrants organized by the Mexican as well as American government, telling them about the job opportunities in Mexico, per se. They should be made aware of the perils of living in a developed country with high expenses, without any secure job. Even, Mexican government should take strict actions against cartels to prevent drug trade. They should strive to prevent manufacturing of drugs. And the US should increase security near their southern border to prevent anyone from crossing the walls or passing through the tunnels. Afterall, a peaceful border between two countries definitely results into benefit for both of them.",False

It can be counterintuitive as many Housewives might feel inferior to women working in other profession or they might have to change their profession because of lack of recognition of their hardwork,even though they might have completely enjoyed doing their work.Such a situation is clearly not good.
The thing women right bodies need to actively do is that they just need to demand for respect in whatever profession they do,they should demand equal involvement,salary,respect,attention not only for actress,doctors,engineers but also as housewife,and doing domestic work.They should not create an image where women is seen sucessful only when they have claimed male dominated areas.Sucess and empowerment should be judged on basis of happiness and freedom.IF A WOMEN IS HAPPY AND ENJOYS FREEDOM AS HOUSEWIFE,LET HER BE. that's also equally important for empowerment of women...

46,0,Manjeet Singh,"I will be presenting my views against the motion ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" 
As we all know, since the majority of the modern era, women have been oppressed and have been devoid of basic freedom like Freedom or speech, voting rights, etc. Only since a decade or two, have we started to see that women are able to stand up for themselves and enjoy the somewhat near the same level of freedom as men. But even now, we regularly see cases of women being oppressed, especially in developing, under-developed and Islamic Countries. 
Due to these reasons, If feminists reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering, It will create an even more oppressive mindset and all improvements we have brought about to end the patriarchal society and make a society where everyone has equal rights will go in vain. As such, we have to keep on pushing the idea of feminism so that soon enough, we can stay in a society where no Women has to work in house out of oppression, a place where they can choose what they want to do no matter their gender.

Many immigrants, particularly those from Central and South America, are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries and are seeking safety and a better life in the United States. However, the journey to the border is often dangerous and many immigrants face abuse, exploitation, and some even die during the journey.
Once at the border, immigrants often face harsh and inhumane conditions, including overcrowding, lack of access to basic necessities such as food, water, and medical care, they are also abuse by border authorities. In recent years, the situation at the border has been aggravated by the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies, which have resulted in the separation of families and the detention of children in inhumane conditions.
The rise of illegal activities, including human trafficking and smuggling, has also contributed to the suffering of immigrants at the border. These criminal networks exploit the vulnerability of immigrants and often subject them to abuse and mistreatment. The illegal nature of these activities also makes it difficult for authorities to address the problem and provide assistance to those in need.
One approach to address this problem would be to address the root causes of immigration, such as violence and poverty, by providing development assistance and support to countries in Central and South America.
Another solution would be to reform the immigration system in the United States to provide a more fair and humane process for immigrants seeking to enter the country legally.",True

Not all men have stopped women from empowering however these feminist have categorized men as stereotypical, imposing personality who are bound to snatch others right and claim them as there's so instead for reclaiming such rights for empowering women should be encouraged to step up in the society and take up opportunities instead of reclaiming certain rights for women and restricting them to women.

46,0,Anurag singh,"Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.[a][2][3][4][5] Feminism holds the position that societies prioritize the male point of view and that women are treated unjustly in these societies.[6] Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and improving educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women.

Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, run for public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception, legal abortions, and social integration and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence.[7] Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for females have often been part of feminist movements.[8]

Many scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender-neutral language, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property.[9] Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.[10] Feminist theory, which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.[11][12]

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years, representing different viewpoints and political aims. Traditionally, since the 19th century, first-wave liberal feminism that sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework was contrasted with labour-based proletarian women's movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory.[13] Since the 1960s, both of these traditions are also contrasted with radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy; together liberal, socialist and radical feminism are sometimes called the ""Big Three"" schools of feminist thought.[14]

Since the late 20th century, many newer forms of feminism have emerged. Some forms have been criticized as taking into account only white, middle class, college-educated, heterosexual, or cisgender perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, such as black feminism and intersectional feminism.[15] Some feminists have argued that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women.[16]",None,False
46,0,Kartik,"....There are people who believe that we do not need feminism today, but nothing could be further from the truth. Women have struggled for equality and against oppression for centuries, and although some battles have been partly won - such as the right to vote and equal access to education – women are still disproportionally affected by all forms of violence and by discrimination in every aspect of life.
It is true that in some areas and on certain issues, there have been improvements: for example, in Saudi Arabia women were allowed, for the first time, to vote and run for office in 2015(!). However, on other issues there has been little or no progress: for example, there have been insignificant reductions in cases of violence against women. Women continue to receive lower pay for the same work as men in all parts of the world; there are still countries that do not have laws against marital rape and still allow child brides, and practices such as 'honour' killings and female genital mutilation still exist.

Jokes about feminism and stereotypes about feminists persist, and many of these are also homophobic and assume that being lesbian is something ‘bad’. In fact, being a feminist is not something particular to any sex or gender: there are women and men who consider themselves feminists, some are gay or lesbian, some heterosexual, bisexual or transgender - and some may identify differently.","The southwestern States that share a border with Mexico–Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California -- are put under strain when they must process illegal immigrants caught with illegal drugs. Illegal immigrants arrested for drug smuggling are not deported, rather they are processed through the local criminal justice system. They are also rarely transferred to the Federal justice system because most are caught with amounts of illegal drugs that are below the unofficial threshold for Federal involvement. Once in custody, local tax money must pay for any medical services, autopsies, or burials that are necessary in the care of the illegal immigrant. As such, border States are under increasing financial strain to support the influx of illegal immigrants that must be processed through the criminal justice system. This study examined two research questions: (1) How does providing law enforcement, criminal justice, and emergency medical services to illegal immigrants affect the workload of each county department in the border States, and (2) what are the financial costs? Site visits were conducted in each county between February 2000 and December 2000. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders and documents concerning county budgets, U.S. Census data, INS border crossing data, Border Patrol apprehension data, newspaper accounts, public documents, and public testimony in congressional hearings were analyzed. Results indicated that the total cost to border counties was approximately $108.2 million in fiscal year 1999. The two California counties carried most of the cost, over 50 percent of the total; however, when measured on a per capita basis, the smallest and poorest counties had the highest financial burden. Over half of New Mexico’s public safety budget in 1999 was spent on criminal illegal immigrants. Emergency medical services cost the 24 counties $19.1 million in fiscal year 1999. Findings should assist lawmakers in designing legislation that would shift the costs of criminal illegal immigrants from the county governments to the Federal Government.",False

Many scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender-neutral language, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles. Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years, representing different viewpoints and political aims. Traditionally, since the 19th century, first-wave liberal feminism that sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework was contrasted with labour -based proletarian women's movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory. Since the 1960s, both of these traditions are also contrasted with radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy; together liberal, socialist and radical feminism are sometimes called the ""Big Three"" schools of feminist thought. This would be sensed as male supremacy .All these works are considered to be backward which needs to be upliftf but that does not mean that these activities should be forced to be done by women.","The Taliban has ruled Afghanistan as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan since taking control by force in 2021, overthrowing the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The takeover was widely criticized by the international community, and no countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the new regime, despite nominally maintaining relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban has aggressively campaigned for international recognition since the takeover. Several countries have vowed never to recognize the Islamic Emirate, and others have said they will do so only if human rights are respected. Some countries have accredited Taliban diplomats at the chargé d'affaires level despite not recognizing the Islamic Emirate.

The Taliban previously ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and received limited diplomatic recognition, with the United Nations and most countries continuing to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan, which the Taliban had reduced to a rump state.

Ousted president Ashraf Ghani has largely remained silent since the takeover, and has not formed a government in exile. Ghani's vice president Amrullah Saleh declared himself caretaker president and relocated to Panjshir Province after the Taliban takeover with the support of the National Resistance Front. However, he fled Afghanistan after the Taliban quickly captured the province. Although the NRF continues to wage a guerrilla insurgency, it has failed to take any territory and neither Saleh nor the NRF have received any international support, leaving the Taliban as the only viable claimant to Afghanistan's government.I personally think that UN should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as there policies are completey against there people.

With the Taliban regaining power in Afghanistan, the next big ambition for the neighbors is for them to concede the organization. It is the polishing of old friendships for some, while it is either the warming up of relationships or the reluctant acceptance of the new reality for others. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates were the only states to acknowledge the Taliban when they first took control in 1996. Apart from that, no other government had acknowledged the militants’ ability to successfully control the country. However, this time they are unwillingly attempting to find ways to engage with the group in order to avoid future significant clashes.

In light of recent negotiations, the EU has declared unequivocally that there is no rush to recognize them. Individual governments in France and Germany, on the other hand, are hardly recognizable as states, and it is not even relevant to them at the moment. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom’s ‘take your time’ attitude obviously encourages utmost caution before recognizing the violent group. Surprisingly, the two foes of the US, Russia and China, are spearheading the charge to make overtures to the Taliban.

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that the Taliban movement currently controls nearly the entire territory of the country, including its capital. These are facts and they must act in accordance with them, not allowing the Afghan state to disintegrate. The Chinese government, on the other hand, sees no other option to protect the interests of Chinese Muslims and has promised not to interfere in Afghanistan’s domestic affairs.

In the case of the United States and India, the issue appears to be much more serious, and the steps have been diplomatic. The US troop withdrawal has raised many questions, to which Biden’s reasons for legitimacy validation and respect for human rights have been stated. However, for India, the security of the concerned Indian nationals living in Afghanistan, as well as the fear of an expected re-alliance between the Taliban and pro-Pakistani militants, are of great importance at the moment. Eventually, what will happen will happen, but for now, the countries are busy evacuating their people from Afghanistan and figuring out how to deal with the Taliban’s current instability in the most diplomatic way possible.",False
5,1,Shridhar Shashank Joshi,"While in the past, domestic activities might have been a way to chain down women, preventing them from seeking education or interacting with the outside world in general, feminists should not promote the abandonment of these activities as they are essential to the functioning of a modern human being. Anyone who has ever lived alone and was not used to doing chores has struggled to settle down. So it is clear that these activities are not lowly and should be promoted. The point of feminism has never been to abandon such crucial activities. It has always been about promoting equality among the sexes. 

It wouldn’t be a stretch to argue that such activities work more to liberate people than they do to suppress them. It is easier for a person who can perform domestic activities to relocate to different parts of the world to pursue better opportunities than for someone to whom such tasks seem alien. Freedom to seek better prospects is a significant step towards empowerment and things that allow us to approach it can not be overlooked as “unimportant” or menial.

For some sections of our society, household activities allow them to earn a living wage. A single mother of 3 with no specialised skills might have to make a living through domestic activities to provide better living conditions and opportunities for herself and her children. 

In conclusion, domestic activities are an essential part of our lives and work to empower women rather than restrain them.","
The immigrants locked between the US-Mexico border are mostly asylum seekers who are waiting to be granted refuge in the USA. Introduced by the Trump administration in 2019, the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), has sent tens of thousands of asylees to Mexico. Contrary to its name, it has inflicted more harm on the migrants than it has protected them. 

After arriving at the US-Mexico border, they are given a court date to argue their admission into the nation and then sent back to Mexico. Due to the lack of housing facilities, the asylum seekers have resorted to living in locations that can only fairly be described as “ghettos”. They have no access to work, education, medical support, and even bathrooms. 

While MPP and the laws surrounding asylum law aim to prevent the misuse of said law, they’re essentially dismantling the whole system of asylum in a way that does not “jump out” to the average man. The “ghettos” where these asylees are staying have also had multiple reports of rape, extortion, and kidnapping. Children are often separated from their parents. We’ve all seen images of kids in cages at the USA border. People desperate for help are often denied entry because it's up to the courts in the USA to decide whether their life is in grave danger.

Asylum is already one of the hardest ways to get into the USA and these laws make it a harsher method. It is regretful to see that a country built by immigrants from the ground up is rejecting them in such a disgraceful manner. Asylees awaiting their court dates have been directed to LatAm countries, namely, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. These countries have been labelled “safe” for the asylees even though many of them escaped from said countries. Families that got away from gang violence, human trafficking, extortion, etc. are forced to return to their countries; back to the same danger, they were escaping from. 

Possible solutions for these issues could be, temporary well-set-up settlements for asylum seekers with the basic requirements for life, regular checking up on asylees by police/military and ensuring the safety of their settlements, and fast and fair court cases for their asylum trials.",False

For empowerment it isn't necessary that they should know domestic activities just to show people that now a women is complete, she knows every household work. A women has already many superpowers as she is a women. People need to grow up their minds and learn that the domestic work isn't labeled for 'women' only. The work whether it is in the home or out of the home is the responsibility of both man and woman without any discrimination to run a family. In India girls many states are still there where girls are stopped from pursuing a career which she wants to pursue just to keep their men's ego and needs on the topmost priority of her life. If they learn cooking, gardening or any household work with their own passion then it's their choice, their skills.

5,1,SAVVYA DAHIYA,"Michelle Obama has appropriately quoted  , ""There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish."" 
Women nowadays take on multiple roles due to changes in economic, social, and educational factors. Today, they are expected to perform these various roles simultaneously, a devoted mother, a caring wife and a committed employee. This has placed an enormous pressure on them as they attempt to balance their personal/family life and work life. Although holding more than one role in life can be hectic and stressful especially for women, it is also a valuable source for continuous learning and grasping skills. They can apply such skills and experience in their home, at work and across different aspect of their lives. Young women embrace the household DIY tasks our mothers and grandmothers were liberated from. Recent reports have proved that the moral structures of our homes have fallen dramatically in the last two generations. Our mothers and house helps are the pillars of society. They are the ones who carry the weight of the house, care for the family and manage household affairs. Housewife is the most under-rated role that a woman plays, but in reality one cannot think a single day without a woman in the house. In many ways whether directly or indirectly a housewife adds to the economic growth of the country. This is the only profession which demands nothing quantitative in return. It demands only love, affection and respect. But we consciously or unconsciously don’t respect this profession .So yes ,  I do  believe that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. ","The cheerful paintings of flowers on the tall metal posts on the Tijuana side of the border fence between the U.S. and Mexico belie the sadness of the Mexican families who have gathered there to exchange whispers, tears, and jokes with relatives on the San Diego side. Many have been separated from their family members for years. Some were deported after having lived in the United States for decades without authorization, leaving behind their children, spouses, siblings, and parents. Others never left Mexico but made their way to the fence to see relatives in the united states. The Biden administration has reactivated overflow facilities and turned family detention facilities into rapid processing centers to make additional space for child migrants.  The united states need to adopt a border system that can adjust to major changes in immigrant arrivals like the one we’re seeing now. A good example is the use of alternatives to detention programs where children and their families check in with non-profit organizations. ",False

So they do not have any time to do their household work like gardening and cooking and most of the time they are thinking that this is not their job as a feminist.

But the question is should they be actively reclaimed? I DON'T THINK SO. They should be treated ""Only as side heroes not the main ones""

We have come through a series of centuries, where women have been oppressed. AND IT IS QUITE UNBELIEVABLE that people haven't stood up. OF COURSE, THEY must have STOOD UP, but sadly we don't see their names, nor were they widely popular. 
And it is also a fact that their major point would have been domestic activities. 
Now, why do these moments weren't successful? It is because(sadly) the psychological thinking of men ( and even some women) is that if people are not making money, they are worthless, we MOSTLY neglect the emotional, mental psyche of individual. At the end(99%) it is how much money once makes.

5,1,Diksha Sharma ,"The feminist approach requires supporting the voice, agency, and empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity and others who face discrimination or marginalization. At its core, feminism is the belief in full social, economic, and political equality for women.
Feminism is committed to ensuring women can fully enjoy their rights on an equal footing with men.For some, the goals of the feminist movement were simple: let women have freedom, equal opportunity, and control over their lives.Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, run for public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave.

The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.Feminists highlight the burden of domestic duties and parental demands and try to instigate laws which could prompt cultural change, like paid parental leave. We still need feminism today because women are constantly seen as the inferior gender, compared to men even when we are at the top of our game.Feminism it's a humane value that we all should stand for. With so many problems in history related to gender equality, violence against women, and women's rights it is essential to forward strive for equality. And unfortunately, there are still a lot of major problems and abuse all over the world against women.

Gender equitable societies are healthier for everyone. As feminism challenges restrictive gender norms, improvements in women's access to health care, reproductive rights, and protection from violence have positive effects on everyone's life expectancy and well-being, especially children.Feminist theology is a movement found in several religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Neopaganism,  Judaism, Islam and New Thought, to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of those religions from a feminist perspective.


 In my point of views women should not be limited in their house only. She should work for herself and should have equal right as compared to a man. In our society womens are meant to be only in kitchen she is not allowed to work or even to put her views. According to our society women is a puppet and she has no feelings.Our society always try to suppress our feelings and will. Female should have same right as man. A female should not be limited in her house only .   

","In 2022 more than 2 million migrants have tried to cross the border which is a  quite  large number. That is a 17% increase from the previous year. 

This continued through Donald Trump’s last months in office, which saw migration rise sharply even as stringent pandemic measures made the pursuit of asylum impossible. This shows the futility of declaring war on asylum, and the inevitability of large migration flows at a time of overlapping security, economic, political, public health, and climate crises.

The jump in migration of Trump’s final months continued accelerating during Joe Biden’s first two months in office. This is happening even as Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) keeps in place “Title 42,” a probably illegal Trump-era pandemic provision that expels most migrants within hours, regardless of their protection needs.

The increased number of people crossing the border right now is something that border experts have predicted for some time now. The roots of what is happening are in the Trump administration policies that caused massive numbers of people to be stuck on the Mexican side of the border—policies like “Remain in Mexico” (which forced over 70,000 asylum seekers to wait for their U.S. court dates in Mexico border cities) and “metering,” a practice under which U.S. border authorities place severe limits on who is allowed to approach ports of entry and ask for asylum, in violation of U.S. and international law.

In my point of view the government should figure out some another way to deal with the situation as the situation of migrants is quite miserable. Thousands of migrants are camping in the col in Mexico near the US border.  Many spent the Christmas weekend on the streets in frigid temperatures. Many are hoping that  US immigration restrictions are about to be lifted. The current rules mean that those who have made it across the border are wary of accepting shelter. Under title 42, the US is allowed to return migrants to Mexico without the chance to request asylum. The US supreme court recently ruled that title 42 could temporarily remain. Temperatures in El Paso are expected to drop to -6 degrees Celsius. In 2022 more than 2 million migrants have tried to cross the border.   This also leads to some illegal activities. Which has a very negative impact on both countries. The future generation will suffer a lot from all these things. 

  To overcome these types of situations countries should promote stability, education, and employment opportunities and reduce the drivers of forced migration. More and more employment is one of the best solutions to this problem. People mainly migrate in search of work so that they can improve their economic conditions. Government should educate the people about different skills to earn.

5,1,Freya Jain,"For decades, our society has seen a rise in the idea of feminism, a rise in it's patrons and the three successive waves that it carried along with it; each of those waves being more radical than its precursor. 
While I appreciate the efforts of the women and men who secured the right to vote and right to education for women back in the 19th and the 20th century, I believe that right now, this pendulum of feminism has swung way further than necessary. It has now become common to see people, especially younger people to constantly berate feminine women and women who prioritise their families over their career. Working women are placed far above on the feminist social ladder while stay at home moms are excluded from the so called 'open and inclusive feminism'. 
I believe that true feminists should support femininity, while corporate jobs can be cracked by anyone who tries just as hard, bearing and raising children is something that is exclusive to women.A mother is emotionally attached and biologically wired to protect and provide for her child. Raising children is a complex job, something that takes time and energy, making staying at home the most suitable option for it. With staying at home, comes all the domestic activities. I respect my mother and all the other mothers who stayed at home, cooked us food and made our home a home. 
Thus, I stand for the motion, ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering.""

The situation in these detention centres is inhumane and punitive, with people living in prison like conditions.Thousands of children have been separated from their parents. The detention centres have poor health care facilities, people are living in lighting and sleep deprivation conditions with inadequate meals and clothing.
On the Mexican side of the border lies a completely different story. The border is lined up with drug cartels and gangs. Any person trying to cross the border has to pay the cartel a ""fee"" and the inability to do so would make them indebted to the cartels. These people are then forced to work for the cartels in the US once they cross the border, to pay off their supposed debts, thus surging illegal activity in the US.
All in all, the immigration system is broken. However, this situation can be improved by enacting on regulations to improve facility conditions, bolster transparency and draw attention to gaps in the government's policy. More humane immigration policies can be made. The system has to improve from the ground up.",False
5,1,Achintya Mouli Sharma,"Feminists should indeed try to reclaim domestic activities as empowering because I believe empowerment is not being in a position of power but rather having the locus of control over one’s own life instead of actively subjugating themselves to self-deprecating thoughts of whether or not they’re doing enough for themselves and the society. As per the google definition of “empowerment”, which states “authority or power given to someone to do something” or “the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one’s life and claiming their rights”, we often stop paying heed to the latter part and put the spotlight on words like “authority”, which results in certain activities losing coherence; most of them being domestic activities, which further contributes to people who do the domestic activities on a daily basis,; which happens to be a majority of the female population, develop a sense of powerlessness, which further depreciates the value of these activities and discourages people from indulging in them which results in a general decrease in quality of life. In no regard, does this mean that feminists should not try to gain a presence in positions of power, but at the same time, they must be aware of the consequences of their actions as they indeed can be detrimental to their own cause. To quote an example, I would not have been in a position of writing this, if my mother had recalled from doing the household work during my jee times, in fact my inability to cook and clean has often landed me in a hard spot whenever she was sick, which made me realise how important and empowering the domestic activities truly are. With this I would like to rest my case that feminists should indeed reclaim domestic activities as empowering.","The question presented offers a unique opportunity for us to question what does it mean to be accepted by the UN. If we take a look at the contemporary world, we can see that the nations recognized by the UN, tend to be in a relative state of peace compared to those who aren’t, which can be attributed to the fact that a nation must be willing to stay peaceful for it to be recognized by the UN, but what is the guarantee that said nation, chooses to be peaceful after the recognition, because if we try to analyze the past activities in the region, we can see that The US, The UK and The Soviets have tried their methods but eventually had to succumb to the situation and fall back as it resulted in a stalemate, which shows us that military might is not the optimized solution to Taliban; which leads us to hope that they will indeed abide by the treaties and remain a peaceful state. In a situation like this one must also consider the casualties in a case, where the nations that can fund the Taliban, choose to recognize it, and granted their emphasis on Muslims, one can assume that their closest allies will be countries where the majority population is of Muslims and have low literacy rates, which would lead to more instability and thus, more slaughter. Judging on this hypothesis, I believe that the UN should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban and prepare appropriate contingencies before any major loss of life even though any loss of life is major loss of life, one can not protect everyone but can protect the masses.",False
46,0,Nehal Garg,"
In today's world the concept of Feminism is a very conflicted notion, but all it implies is equality for women in all walks of life. It does not portray women as superior.  Empowering domestic issues is important as still even if a woman is earning and self independently, the society expects her only to do domestic activities like cooking, dusting in absence of a helpers or instead of a helper. 
Even small chores such as folding clothes, making bed, setting table is expected of her. Why are domestic works only expected of women even after them being independent and strong and confident? These activities must be empowered so that anyone can feel confident and share a sense of authority.
 When we hire different helpers for cleaning, cooking, gardening we pay them to show that we value what they do but why when a family member does the same work, we just neglect it. Empowering domestic Activities will give due credit to all homemakers of our countries who make the lives of their families so easy and comfortable but are under appreciated. This will give them due respect and confidence and a sense of self independence. Doing domestic chores will give them a pride that they can take care of themselves in time of need. 
The most important thing is that domestic activities should not only be tagged with women. Everyone person should learn to do the chores as you never know when the situation might require it. Promoting empowerment in domestic activities will also create a sense of self sufficiency. During pandemic this notion became more important as everyone were quarantined at home and had to do all the household chores themselves. In today's society cooking or embroidery has become an art form and chefs, fashion designers and other artistic people all over the world are recognized for this. 
Thus, not only feminists but people from all walks of life should promote empowerment of domestic activities to give credit where credit is due to all people whose hard work is neglected.




","Taliban is recognized as terrorist organization by the people of the wrold.  The key reason they should be opposed is because they undermine the primary democratic principles laid by the UN. They were not elected by the people of Afghanistan, and they forced themselves on the Afghanis. 
 They used violence and spread a reign of terror among the Afghanis and forced them to seek refuge in other countries. 
At present, women and non-Muslim people are suffered the most. They denied women and girls their basic freedom and right to education. Non- Muslims people were treated inhumanly and were persecuted. They preach an extreme form of Militant Islamism which caused some Talibanis  to leave their own organization. Women were banned from working; girls were forbidden to go to schools and universities and were required to separate themselves from men that were not their direct family or their husbands. 
 If the UN recognizes the Taliban, this will only encourage them to continue this religious Holocaust. They are internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic laws which resulted in brutal treatment of many Afghans. For their basic source of income, Taliban practiced human trafficking and sold harmful drugs. They reportedly created tensions internationally by bombings in 2005, 2009, 2015 which resulted in many casualties. Taliban also did cultural genocide when they destroyed the statue of Lord Buddha in Bamiyan. Every form of art, music and dance was banned. 
Given the above inhumane rules and beliefs followed by the Taliban, they should be fought against and removed from the face of Afghanistan. they invalidate the basic democratic ideology of people's country accepted worldwide. Instead of global recognition, the UN should take actions against it and look out for ways to repress the Talabani reign.

5,1,Parijat Sinha,"""Women have a voice, all that is needed is to raise it for it to be heard"". Hello readers I  here to speak against the motion on the given topic. Feminism is rooted in the belief of equality. Any task or chore cannot and should not be gender biased. Saying that household chores such as gardening, cooking, etc are meant for women or not for men to do. I strongly oppose the given motion that women should reclaim domestic activities as empowering. Women don't need to claim any task as empowering. They should be free to do what they wish. As a matter of fact no one should be looked down on for doing anything legal. In today's world we are taught about respecting all professions and jobs. So no task regardless of how small it maybe can be regarded as demeaning. If women start claiming these tasks as empowering, it will further the strengthen beliefs of those who think women suit best behind kitchen doors and not out in the world. For empowering women in place of enforcing such ideas we need to have more women discover the world out and choose what they want to do and what is the life they want to live be it behind closed doors. Therefore I end my argument by saying that empowerment is based on the idea of freedom, hence women should have the right to say what is right for them and what is not","The annexation of Afghanistan by the Taliban was no act of democracy or for public benefit. It was a selfish and planned move to make Afghanistan an autocracy.

It is an unjust regime which has imprisoned women in their homes in the name of sharia, has snubbed the media and free speech, made it impossible for migrants to survive, has no fundamental rights for its citizens and allows terror to thrive . Since the overthrow of the government, Afghanistan has been in a state of turmoil with little information out in the open. Terrorists have become ministers dictating their opinion on the entire country with no one to keep them in check. It's a joke on the name of democracy..

We all should find time for domestic activities, if anyone else (partner/supporter) finds us genuine, he or she can help us doing these activities when we're busy and we too can help them, but also at the same time, everyone should be independent and responsible doing their primary work and domestic chores. All human beings shouldn't feel ashamed to do their household chores themselves. And it should be our choice whom we're going to help. We can't set a hard and fast rule that feminists should be reclaiming, it will be wrong I believe, each and every one is going towards a goal which liberates them, doesn't mean they're not going to have time for personal chores. It's our duty to stop exploiting others just for more profit and comfort. And women too, should work and earn for themselves and see these activities as nurturing the body to work for the mission.

If Taliban is getting support of any nation, that Nation's values should be questioned. US moved back its army, but if we just ignore this hub of violence and we leave it to just the people of Afghanistan, we are promoting terrorism as they will become more powerful day by day conquering more territories and if they get recognition, this darkness will spread in coming generations too. It is our duty and responsibility to have a peaceful yet effective framework to boycott the Taliban. We have to force them to dethrone themselves and conduct democratic elections there just the same way India once did with Bangladesh.

The increased numbers of people crossing the border right now is something that border experts have predicted for some time now. The roots of what is happening are in the Trump administration policies that caused massive numbers of people to be stuck on the Mexican side of the border—policies like “Remain in Mexico” (which forced over 70,000 asylum seekers to wait for their U.S. court dates in Mexico border cities) and “metering,” a practice under which U.S. border authorities place severe limits on who is allowed to approach ports of entry and ask for asylum, in violation of U.S. and international law. 

The increased border crossings was predictable, not because of Biden administration policies like winding down “Remain with Mexico,” but because of the dangers put in place by Trump’s cruel and illegal policies of deterrence.


The increased border crossings was predictable, not because of Biden administration policies like winding down “Remain with Mexico,” but because of the dangers put in place by Trump’s cruel and illegal policies of deterrence. There should be no need for asylum seekers to seek out smugglers to cross the border—they should be able to show up to a designated location and go through an administrative process.

The rise in migrants crossing the border will continue to increase this spring, regardless of the Biden administration’s gradual expansion of its capacity to process asylum seekers seeking protection in the United States. Persistent violence, a pandemic economic collapse, and historically severe hurricanes have created an acute need to migrate to seek protection and economic survival. In the face of this, the Biden administration’s responsibility is to manage these increased migration flows in an orderly, rights-respecting way, upholding the dignity of people forced to flee.

This was the basic ideology that followed feminism. With recognition to the topic of feminism with the help of social media platforms, most of the demands of the activists seems to be fulfilled. I still believe that at a partial level, women still face some difficulty and have to prove themselves at some point in their lives and such flaws do pass by in the process. with governments aiming at women's empowerment these drawbacks do tend to get solved.
Now, women are reserved a percentage in various companies, they are paid equally to their male counterparts for the same position, they can be independent, and sustain themselves as a sovereign entity and no men can dictate any rules over a female, they are treated equally and there prevails different laws to ensure that women are not victimized in any country(Except some middle-eastern countries where burqa tradition still creeps and women have to retaliate for even to study).

On the other hand, seeing that Taliban functions just as any other dictatorship to which UN has given recognition like North Korea which even after the ratification of nuclear treaties likes NPT, CTBT, etc develops nuclear weapons in the name of nuclear energy. thus to stop such things from happening with Taliban which will lead to nuclear terrorism and definitely worsen the scenario, Taliban should be asked for a government whether democratically elected or not which should be  accountable for its actions, human rights, defy any war or armaments treaty should be met with huge sums as penalties and international shame, non-compliance of such rules can cost them a recognition and it can not put forward its ideas in UNGA. making it recognised in the UN would put it under international pressure through diplomatic ties with other nations that will force them to either uplift Afghanistan but it could backfire and turn Afghanistan to a dictatorship.",False

Domestic workers whether men or women should not be looked down upon. But, also classifying this type of work as empowering not only limits women who are aspiring for greater roles in society from achieving their goals but also assumes the potential of women getting into positions of power and providing economic contributions to society as insignificant. True empowerment only comes when someone is able to provide for themselves financially and make decisions for themselves not when they are designated to work which is considered insignificant but also results in them not being treated fairly. Actual empowerment will be when not only women are in positions of power but also when female participation in the workforce and contribution to GDP is high.

46,0,Ashwani Sangwan ,"To begin with I would like to say that ""we don't need a patriarchal society, we don't need a matriarchal society, we just need a human society."" Both males and females should have equal rights and liberties and no one should impose their will on the other sex. There was a time when almost every country was led by men. Men had all the privileges and rights while women were restricted to the four walls of the house. They were only expected to cook food, clean the house and serve the men which was unfair as sex does not decide your fate and destiny. Many social workers and activists fought against this patriarchal mindset and unequal division of power. They demanded equality which was not easy but at last the men understood their point and stepped back and gave women their fair chance. They gained every privilege that they once dreamt of. But with time the definition of feminism and the agenda of feminists have changed. They began with equality and have now reached to demand superiority and dominance over men. This led to the construction of the term 'pseudo feminism .' I think the so called feminists need to understand that no work is small and also doing any work does not make you small as well. If we go by the book then I don't think I can recall any superior privilege that males have and females don't. So feminist need to understand that household works are also an important aspect of society and can be as empowering as any nondomestic work. At the end of the day there is nothing to be ashamed of doing any work let it be inside the house or outside the house .

Taliban has always maintained close ties with al-Qaeda so it is pretty evident that both these organizations can launch many international terrorists attacks from Afghan soil.

Due to this they don't have any outer world experience and remain meek and silent to all the exploitation imposed upon them. I don't completely defy this fact that they shouldn't be knowing domestic work but to some extent. I feel that feminist should actively promote jobs in field that are male dominant as it would give women the confidence to stand neck to neck with them.

There has been a huge change in the life of Afghans. The Taliban has took over forming islamic republic. This has drastically affected the whole world  especially  themselves. They are no longer a democratic country but a dictatorship.  Their  freedom has been taken , strict rules have been imposed , and they are constantly  living in fear of there lives. Young citizens have caused a havoc in attempt to leave  the country before it comes too late . jamming the airports. This situation  according to me is because of usa negligence. Had it dealt with afganistan tactfully this wouldn't have happened . I think the UN should not recognise the taliban because they are forcefully  exercising there power.

They should impose sanctions if anything goes wrong  and there human  rights are denied",False
5,1,Aman kumar Jha ,"In today's modern era of world order, where the gender equality is considered a social norm. There are still some questions left unanswered in the circle of gender equality activists, challenging the primitive social structure. Our society has come a long way giving women right to vote, education and to be on the equal footing with their opposite counterparts. But about the pseudo discrimination women all around the world faces?? Among the pseudo discrimination one of the discrimination women face that they don't notice is.....IS WOMEN DOING HOUSEHOLD CHORES MISOGYNY and OPPRESSIVE??

What i personally believe women doing all house hold work is one of the shackles of the dark past full of exploitation and oppression, which women knowingly unknowingly still carry to this date. As, we know in past women were only considered to a gender only to raise child's, do household work and serve their husbands. They were barred from doing any different kind profession other than of a house wife. Still to this day we see especially in our region women carry out day to day house hold affairs be it cooking, washing, gardening, etc. Men are still considered the master of the house. You know why such power dynamic exist, because in most of the cases men are going outside the house earning money for their family, which unknowingly gives upper hand to the man in house. As economic dependency of wife, a daughter, a sister makes them helpless and dependant. For me, doing a job which gives you a financial independence is a way of liberating you and makes you more worthy, which clearly we can see household chores are not. I don't think doing house hold works is anything less, but it's not economically productive to the individual as well as on the larger level the nation is being affected, as our half of the work force is not engaging in a money generating source.

 To this date girls from early age, especially in rural and less income areas are taught household works, affecting their studies. Even we can see this problem in the upper middle class where women are educated and have job, but still are expected to do some household chores.... isn't it exploitation. I think both men and women should know the basics of household chores and both should be equally engaging in it. ","On 29th Feb 2020 , under the presidency of then US president Donald Trump US made a historic peace deal in Doha with Taliban, which made a big turmoil in already war torn country of Afganistan. After a long 20 year war on terror which should be over after killing of Osama bin Laden, which didn't happened. US decided to pull it's troops back from Afganistan. Which were stationed there fighting the taliban and other terrorist groups after 9-11 attacks. The peace deal was the final stamp on the withdrawal of America's troops from Afganistan, as it made it necessary for Taliban to not attack US soldiers while withdrawing. During the withdrawal, Taliban started to take control of Afganistan in an armed struggle against Afganistan National army. Within a month after the US forces started to withdraw, Taliban became the new government of Afganistan toppling the US installed government headed by president Ashraf Ghani. Which started the biggest humanitarian crisis of the decade.

When Taliban became the all governing body of Afganistan. It created a huge refugee crisis, as people started to rush to save their lives from their awaiting deaths. UN as well as majority of the countries refused to recognise the taliban as the legitimate government of Afganistan. I think it was the right thing to do so, who will ever in their right mind will legitimise  extremists , radicals, terrorists to run a country . Taliban say they have reformed and are different from that of black Taliban days of afganistan between 1997-2002, where every same thing was banned including music. Women were treated worse than animals, there were no modern education system, women were barred from education and job opportunities, women were seen dependent on men. Killing and discrimination of minorities were a norm, Banyan buddha blast is a great example. But you shouldn't trust the words of the fox, all is hoax coming from Taliban...Taliban is showing their true faces every other day. They have formerly issued notice shutting down educational institutions for girls and barred girls to work. They have released many renowned terrorists from prison , what you can expect from the government where the ministers are on the global terror list. Recognising them will only make thing worse, it seem we're validating their atrocities on women, children and minorities. If left alone like this. Afganistan can become a breeding ground for Various terrorist organisations disturbing the world peace.

But at the same time we can't overlook the humanitarian crisis which is enveloping the Afganistan . Food shortage and economic collapse being the most important things. We can help the comman people of Afganistan by aiding the NGOs and UN teams working their providing food, rations and medical support to the needy ones. UN nad other countries can give them financial assistance and help the to arrange these things on large scale. We also need to facilitate the refugees coming out from Afganistan as well as make arrangements of the visas for the people in need that are struck in Afganistan.At the same time we can put pressure economically and bring them to table, making them to form a democratically elected inclusive government. Which will have a certain liberal behaviour toward its women, children and minorities. Only then we can see a robust Afganistan.",False
5,1,Nivedhiya J Panicker ,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. In the context of the Western culture, especially in the United States, women have been consistently viewed as being in charge of raising children and taking care of the household. The feminist writers, who were also housewives, have contributed to these stereotypes.

As a result, women are still viewed as homemakers while men are viewed as breadwinners. And when it comes to family roles, this has become an even bigger problem for women. This imbalance leads to a lot of stress for both genders since society forces them into “productive” roles that they might not want or enjoy doing.

Feminists in the 1960s and 1970s tended to reject caretaking activities such as cooking and cleaning as ""women’s work"" and associated them with the domestic sphere that was deeply resented for its lack of autonomy.

However, feminists in recent years have been rethinking the popular assumption that these tasks are only women’s responsibility.The concept of a ""domestic feminist"" has emerged from this shift in thinking, which includes cooking and gardening among other tasks traditionally considered to be “feminine,"" while also rejecting traditional ideals of femininity.

Due to the lack of safe and affordable childcare many women have been forced to leave their careers and give up on higher education in order to take care of their children.

The main problem comes from the lack of a social safety net where there is no support from government. It's also important to acknowledge that women have been taking care of these tasks for centuries, because they are inherently nurturing and caring.

Some feminists see this as a natural extension or evolution of feminism. Other feminists find it problematic in this case because the burden is still placed on women, and by extension motherhood, thus reinforcing gender stereotypes.

We should embrace this idea that perpetuates the idea that being a woman means taking care of others - as long as we do so with full awareness and consent.","US should recognise the Islamic State of Afghanistan as it is their right to self-determination. The Talibans have anexated the country illegally and it is more than fair that the US recognises them. .Of course they are going to want to. They're going to fight for their freedom, they're going to fight for their life, and if the US is saying that you can't have your freedom because we don't recognize you then well I mean it's really not a surprise that they would say no.

Recently, the United States of America helped Afghanistan by investing in democratic institutions and rebuilding a modern society. This was done to prevent Afghanistan from reverting back to being anistan - a land of war. lords and anarchy. The United States government is investing in Afghanistan to make sure the Afghan government can handle its own affairs. The United States Government will no longer be involved in Afghanistan's internal affairs.

46,0,Raima Rajan,"I think feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering. Empowerment is a sense of authority or power that comes from within. Housekeeping is a field where a lot of women feel that they have authority and power within the household. Many women find internal satisfaction while taking care of their families, which for them surpasses the satisfaction gained from economic aspects of life. Sadhguru has rightly said that ""The value of success need not always be measured in terms of economics, it has to be measured in terms of life.” Choosing to do domestic activities is no less deserving of consideration because it provides comfort and emotional support to the family. In today's world where feminists are actively encouraging women to work and earn, doing household chores is disregarded. Working as a housewife or even being a working woman who chooses to work at home as well requires hard work, patience, care and causes physical, mental and emotional fatigue. This is taken for granted and is considered as a thankless job. Earlier, educated or uneducated women were forced to take up household chores and their passion was considered of no importance. Feminists fought to take decisions on their own and follow their heart, but it is pretty ironic how women of today's generation cannot follow their decision of being a homemaker because it is looked down upon. To sum everything that has been stated so far, choosing to do domestic activities should be perceived as empowering because women’s choice and passion should not be disregarded or disapproved at any cost.","With the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, I do not think that the UN should recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. United Nations has put forward ‘The International Bill of Human Rights’ which consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a milestone document in the history of human rights. It is drafted by representatives belonging to different legal and cultural backgrounds from all corners of the world. The preamble of UDHR states that ”If man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.” The Taliban violates each and every single article mentioned in the UDHR. Article 2 of UDHR says that irrespective of the cast, colour, sex or religion everyone is entitled to have equal rights and freedom. Afghans who belong to minority religious groups have been fleeing the country to avoid religious persecution. For instance, three Afghan Sikhs who returned to India following the Taliban takeover were seen carrying ‘saroops’ of Shri Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism. Furthermore, the Taliban violated Articles 4 and 5 of UDHR which clearly state that no one should be held in slavery and subjected to torture and cruelty. A news report covered by CNN said that a 9-year-old citizen of Kabul named Parwana was sold to a 55-year-old man by her parents for slavery so that they could afford their day-to-day meals. Overall, the Taliban has been violating human rights like freedom of expression, suppressing women and not giving equal opportunities to the citizens of Afghanistan. Recognising the Islamic Emirate of Taliban will be allowing terrorists to rule over Afghanistan and will be highly unfair to its citizens.",False

If women are better at domestic activities like gardening, cooking, taking care of kids, then it's okay to be proud of it.   Let's take a case in which a woman riding a scooty hits another vehicle, I'm not saying the woman's fault is to be overlooked, but in today's world where there are lot of memes, in a short period, we see hundreds of memes related to that incident. Similarly why there are not lot of memes on men failing to do many household chores, failing to maintain children and the house. That's because of the less no. of women who are meme creators. As time changes. there are always different ways to embed a thought in the society. Why can't men be asked to do all these things and then see who needs to come at equal level.

The major issue in ""NEW"" Afghanistan is the rights of women. Their movement has been made limited. They are not allowed to go outside without men. Recently, it has been declared that women are no longer allowed to attend schools and colleges because they do not follow certain dress codes.

But as the centuries passed by Females are now portrayed as the leading figure in every field walking hand in hand with males when provided with all the suitable requirements  which she need to live a life on her own terms. But the GenZ generation feminist is now avoiding and declining the pride in learning household chores as they are considering them low work activities. Truly education empowers every individual to work as per his / her will and make own progressive individual decision but forgetting work deeds that make us a whole different person is of a different concern. Household Chores are an important learning for every individual as they act as the primary act of managing and involves lot of learnings like Time Management, Effective Work System, Efficiency. Feminist perceives that if males are not interested in learning household chores and are not pressured to learn household work why do we and what is the reason to feel empowering about it. The reality is that if an educated female learns that the need to understand and lern household works she might also encourage her own son or daughter to learn them as she herself would understand the reality and experience of learning all these activities as they make you humble and self independent. Also understanding  the nature and extent every housewife goes in managing their house and all the work is empowering enough to learn you just need to have esteem and attitude to learn and understand every work profile is never too low of social learning. 
Especially the profile of a Housewife . ",In my opinion since UN being the international organization for World Peace and Stability I hereby decline the Idea that UN should regard Taliban Regime in Afghanistan as a Nation as By the factors and the criteria Taliban regime in Afghanistan is considered a nation state as it has all the factors that declare a country a nation state but the sudden uprising of the Taliban and forceful annexation and the horror crisis emerged after there takeover and the post effects that the people are bearing makes it impossible for UN to accept it as its member. The Policy of Gender Stereotyping and not allowing girls to go to school and colleges many bans and restrictions curtail a girls from having a independent choice of live which they wished for and Since the region is also the concerned factor of Terrorism in the International Arena as well accepting them will also be a symbol of acceptance of Terrorism. UN also being the promoter of Human Rights and Living Standards and Gender Equality that are being disheveled in Taliban regime right now. Being the state of matter and concern that North Korea is also a part of UN being a prime dictator country the reason for its acceptance claim to be that the country image to be portrayed and the problems to be dealt with are unaware and their recognition was done in the basis of the fact during the era of Cold War (1945-1991) as both the Superpowers in the world were creating a more support base in the World Politics Arena creating a push and pull of countries into these power blocs. As per the case of Taliban it's uprising has always been a bad impression on Western Countries especially USA as a matter of fact all the past history records of Terrorist events and it's after effects faced by the entire world taken by USA eg. Incident of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba makes it a undeniable preposition that It shouldn't be accepted as a part of UN and primarily USA being the highest budgetary contributer and It is a visual fact that UN is not an independent organization it is a organization not a nation state and works upon its member countries opinion. Recognizing Taliban as a Nation state is a threat to humanity as a whole as we are accepting a part which shouldn't be as the history which was done in Cold War shouldn't be repeated as it would only act as becoming a part of that policy that resists rights of a it's nation's women and any further international involvement will create matters worse. ,False
5,1,Parth keswani,"If we talk about the rural areas, then there for a woman irrespective of the fact that she is earning a bread or not , she has to do the so called odd jobs like gardening dusting sweeping etc,but for a man even if he is jobless he will not do the household works because these are the odd jobs and by doing such works he will feel like losing his manhood. In some cases situation is even worse than this and then the feminist movement is the only support to the poor rural women and if they also start considering doing Household works as empowering than it will worsen the condition,but if we see the urban picture its quite the opposite there are nuclear families as well as joint families where people have maids to do all the household work because according to the urban women  even if they are unemployed they feel like  these are the odd jobs and why should they only do it, and hence misusing the feminist movement.So in general many rural women would be affected badly if feminists reclaim domestic activities as empowering, but in urban areas where the fake feminists have quite a population this step is very much needed","We are sitting at home enjoying our lives but we can not even imagine what people of Afghanistan are going through , just imagine being denied basic education , being forced to wear a hijab, not allowed to roam freely,  on the streets just because u are a woman. Taliban didn't captured Afghanistan peacefully thousands were killed leaving lakhs with post traumatic stress and depression entire economy of Afghanistan was shattered.

United nations is by far the most reputed and trusted organization and if they start recognising taliban then this will do no good to the world instead it will give the confidence to taliban itself, and by looking at it there are thousands of other terrorist organisation -the so called brand ambassador of peace like al-qaeda,lashkar-e-jhangvi, they will also get the motivation to attack smaller countries and capture them just like taliban and in worst case scenario it might even lead to world war three which will bring destruction and nothing else. Such things used to happen till the late 18th  and 19th century when if you want to be recognised by the world ,if you want to be considered as powerful you will have to capture other territories by waging a war against them which will eventually kill millions.

Hence if united nations starts recognising the Taliban government it will be bring shame to the whole world and UN too that  they are recognising a government which denies education to women.",False

At its root, feminism has a single goal in mind: gender equality. 
But it's frequently referred to as ""the other F-word."" a profane term.

What does being a feminist entail? Upholding the principles of gender equity means what exactly? How can we support and fight for women from all walks of life?

The answer is simple. Supporting women in whatever they do,  making them realise the power they possess within themselves and helping them break free from the confines of internalised misogyny is how feminism, in my opinion will change lives of my fellow f folks.

This is impossible while women are burdened with mundane domestic tasks. 


The burden of unpaid work falls disproportionately on women in India because majority chores are highly gendered, and patriarchal norms dictate that women also validate men’s failure to assume domestic responsibilities and thus entrench womens unequal social status.

Claiming these domestic tasks as a means of empowerment would only ever lead to disastrously uneven distribution of chores. 

Some women , turn themselves inside out to instil feminism in their children.They adopt gender neutral wardrobes for themselves and their children. They carefully choose books with strong female protagonists. They refuse to let their children watch Disney movies and forgo all things pink and princessy for their daughters.

However, they also openly shoulder the majority of childcare and household duties even in two-parent homes, undercutting  the feminist values they are attempting to convey to their children.

In my opinion, the way to go about empowerment in this age is through boosting a woman’s self esteem. Making them realise that their voices are as strong and meaningful as their male counterparts. Making it easier for them to work their jobs without the pressure of handling domestic chores all alone. Normalizing women being financially independent while being married or unmarried. 
Women will be empowered when people start appreciating them for something bigger than their beauty. Being told that they are brilliant and intelligent and deadly good in what they do, rather than just being reduced to a pretty face is what we need.
Spreading body positivity is another aspect. Because of the puritanical fear of female sexuality and desire, people with vaginas have a serious lack of knowledge about their body. Being honest about our bodies is the best approach to eliminate this stigma.


To me, fostering safety and being open about your thoughts are ways to improve our standard of living.

It’s simple to assert that one gender is superior to the other or that men simply have more competent abilities than women.
The truth is that both men and women should have equal opportunities to pursue any endeavour they choose in life.

Feminism is having confidence. It is normalizing the fact that both men and women can do the same tasks with same efficiency. We want every woman to feel empowered to speak her mind. We want every woman to be inspired to raise her hand and succeed, and have the confidence to risk failure in the pursuit of excellence.

The question of recognizing the Taliban, scrutinizes the coherence of international law.

There are significant problems with the Taliban’s legitimacy both within and outside. Internally, the Taliban have seen many waves of opposition and uprisings across the nation, demonstrating a general discontent with their authority.


Recognition of the Taliban by the UN and other states would not only violate some important principles of international law, but would also have serious domestic and international ramifications.
While the Taliban’s recognition would undermine Afghans’ right to self determination, which is enshrined in the United Nations Charter, it would embolden other terrorist organisations around the world to overthrow governments and then demand international recognition as the legitimate government of the states they’d seized.


International law and practise now place a greater emphasis on a government’s ability to claim legitimacy through elections, ballot initiatives, or other forms of popular participation.

Since the Taliban took control of Kabul, there have been ongoing demonstrations, acts of civil disobedience, and increasingly violent clashes that have called into question their legitimacy.

What’s more, how can the UN or any one state recognise a government in which several cabinet members, including the interior minister, are designated as terrorists by the UN and several states? 

The Taliban have not stopped engaging in terrorism since seizing control of Kabul, nor have they severed relations with other terrorist organisations. Instead, the organisation is close to creating a permanent army of suicide bombers.

The Taliban's recognition would provide a desirable model for terrorist organisations around the world: If they successfully overthrow their governments, they are sure to receive worldwide recognition.

5,1,Vartika Thapliyal ,"For the motion:
I believe that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering for a number of reasons. domestic activities such as gardening and cooking can be personally empowering for individuals as they allow us to take control of our own spaces and our own bodies. They can provide a sense of accomplishment and pride, and can be a form of self-care and self-expression.Also,These activities have often been traditionally associated with femininity and have been used to limit the roles and opportunities available to women. By reclaiming these activities and valuing them as important and fulfilling, feminists can challenge and subvert these limiting gender roles.Overall, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering is a way for feminists to resist and challenge traditional gender roles and to assert agency and control over their own lives.","Following the Taliban take over of the Afghan government, the country has faced an economic and humanitarian crisis. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) projected that by mid-2022, Afghanistan could face “universal poverty,” with 97% of Afghans living below the international poverty line of 1.90 USD per day. Even as international aid is provided, the Afghan economy is struggling to recover due to its previous reliance on external donor assistance, previously supporting ~75% of the Afghan Government’s expenditures before being cut off in late August. For example, major donors such as the US and European States have suspended assistance, the World Bank halted disbursements, and the IMF blocked access to its credit and asset lines. This has caused widespread discussion and debate of whether or not the international community should recognize the Taliban’s Islamic Emirate.It is important to note that the recognition of a government by the international community, including the United Nations (UN), is a complex process that involves a number of considerations and is ultimately the decision of the UN and its member states. Factors that may be considered when deciding whether to recognize a government include whether the government is representative of the people, respects the rule of law and human rights, and is committed to the principles of the UN Charter.
Recognition of a government can have a number of potential impacts, both positive and negative, on the country and the international community. For example, recognition may provide a government with increased legitimacy and international support, which could potentially help to address challenges such as economic and humanitarian crises. However, recognition may also involve certain obligations and expectations, such as the requirement to adhere to international norms and standards.
There are many factors that may prevent countries from recognizing a particular government, including political, economic, and security considerations. In addition, the recognition of a government by the international community may have implications for relations with other countries and for the stability and security of the region.",False
46,0,Pranshu Lakhotia ,"I strongly believe in the fact that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. Firstly I would like to clarify the definition of a feminist which is who believes in having social,economical and political equality among both the sexes.No gender inequality in the form of work,position and power is seen in the world of feminism. In recent times their has been a belief that doing domestic activities is a very narrow minded job and it is not a sign of equality, however that's not the case.Women can do whatever they like and if they find pleasure in doing household stuff then I find it absolutely perfect. The opposition may argue that in this way we are again forcing women to get locked in their houses and not do anything else, but feminism was never about forcing women to leave their houses and then earn financial stability.Household work such as cooking,gardening should not be seen as less important, they consume equal level of hardwork as any other bread earning jobs.If any women likes doing domestic activities without any pressure she doesn't need to be looked down by any other fellow as if she is not being that well assumed ""modern woman"".Being traditional doesn't mean to be uneducated and not believing in equal rights,it's just each person's own enthusiasm to follow and practice their passion. Yes getting financially independent is must and it should continue as it is. Finance independent should never be comprised for domestic activities. If we look from orthodox view these activities were considered inferior because they were not paid but now due to increased awareness among the people these activites have also gained equal importance and require even more manpower than other.Women's freedom can only be achieved if she can perform all work without hesitation and not thinking any job superior or inferior to other.""Don't put me in a box"" is a very apt statement for feminism as they want to explore as much as they can and are then capable of making their own decisions. Feminism is about being successful woman not necessary in the materialistic way but in the way you want to be fighting for what you want not waiting for others to give you what you need.These domestic activities are now also equally paid so empowering them would already mean social and financial equality. Respecting every profession and treating them at par and not distinguishing them as ""domestic"" or ""capital earning"" would be a major step towards this empowerment. Thus I would like to now conclude and say that feminism is not only a metaphysical issue for philosophy, but one that is also just for everyone, ethical and epistemological.
","UN should definitely not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. First question which comes to our mind is what does recognition of government mean. The recognition of a state under international law is a declaration of intent by one state to acknowledge another power as a ""state"" within the meaning of international law. Recognition constitutes a unilateral declaration of intent. Many states have linked recognition to the formation of an inclusive and representative government, respect for human and women’s rights, and a commitment to counter-terrorism which are not been followed by Taliban. Taliban is not following any constitution giving it supreme authority to treat everyone and everything according to their own will. They have immensely restricted press freedom so that world doesn't get to know the harsh treatment done by them to the public. Most girls are being denied of getting basic rights such as education. Women are caged in their houses and not being allowed to go on streets without a man. Child marriages are taking place and women are forced to wear burkha. Taliban is bombing homes, killing innocent people, spreading communal intolerance, taking away the basic human rights and using it's territory as a platform to many illegal actions across the globe .People are dealing with food insecurity and standards of living have been utterly downgraded. The US and European countries have banned foreign trade with the new Taliban government which would directly affect its income and international relationship. Instead of developing the country Taliban is using all it's wealth to get more and more arms and ammunitions and capturing territories. They are also enlisting the soft power of religious scholars, trying to persuade the entire country not to resist Taliban rule. Perhaps most importantly, the Taliban have reiterated a general amnesty, applicable to everyone who abstains from fighting them, and reached out to former enemies, urging their ex-foes to help rebuild state institutions including the security forces. Are we even supposed to call this piece of land a ""nation"" as nation is for people, by people and of people where they can live happily and can even raise their voice for any inappropriate act? Taliban has broken several international laws related to security and human rights thus waging wars with several other countries.No peace exist between the government and people.Hence it must not be socially recognised as the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as it doesn't qualify any criteria to be a true nation which would help themselves to develop and grow.",False
5,1,Vartika Nathani,"Rightly said , ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities  as empowering"". I would like to speak for the above statement. If we question , who is a feminist? One who stands for gender equality taking women as the priority. How can we forget that we are living in this 21st century where there is nothing left which a woman cannot do whole heartedly. In olden times women were considered to be object working 24*7 at home sometimes cooking , cleaning , gardening and this way the day just finished off. But how can we say that by doing domestic activities , a woman is being suppressed in the society. It's a woman who runs the house. Infact women are not only working in MNCs but also managing their families at the same time. Doing house activities does not make a woman of lower class in the society. Feminists should respect the domestic activities done by a woman. I believe that it's a woman's choice whether she wants to work in office or she enjoys working at home or may be she can even be capable of working in both the fields. So , a feminist cannot declare that women wokring in domestic field are not empowering. There are women who feel that home is their foremost priority so nobody can conclude saying these non working women are incapable of reaching to greater heights in their lives. Feminists fighting for the gender equality shouldnt drag and judge women who like to work at their home. Women have passion in doing things in a greater way and if they are happy in being working in their houses, they cannot be questioned on their capabilities. The toughest job in the world is for a woman to work at home whole day and night with a smile on the face and still they are least valued. Therefore feminists should start considering domestic activites to be even more empowering.  Hence I conclude by saying that women do great in whatever field they are whether workplace or home so there comes no question upon women's capabilities.Therefore , feminists should reclaim domestic activities as empowering.","US - Mexico border dispute has been a concern from American - Mexican war when US annexed the Republic of Texas leading to the border dispute.

Feminism was all about being valued as an equal, in every social and economical way.

Doing a chore can be empowering for both the genders but we grew up to think a certain way and associate a certain job to one gender. I believe in this age we are all much more aware than we can ever be because of the internet, no matter how hard it exposes us, it enlightens us as well, about our privilege, our marginalisation amongst a few other pressing topics. sticking to this idea of a woman feeling empowered because of them doing something that they’re associated to just shows us how we haven’t quite used the internet well.

perceives that strength.
Since my childhood I have always seen my grandmother,then my mother and then my sister taking hold of all the domestic chores of my family. No wonder all the males in the family used to call them STRONG.In our society, it is taken for granted that females should take care of all the household activities and the males will look after the jobs to run the family. I firmly believe that work should not be associated with gender, but I myself being a feminist think that we should not actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. If we actually look into the matter , seeing domestic works as women empowering will not help in lifting women’s condition. On the contrary there are chances that it can take us back to the dark ages. If feminists start supporting domestic activities, then patriarchs will get a chance to justify their thinking of keeping women behind men. The  need of the the society at this time is to change the already existing condition of women. This is a need to change bring about a change in what most women do these days i.e, domestic chores. This will not only help to empower women but also to change the way , the society perceives women.In the end I would like to conclude that any domestic work done by either women or men will not help us in empowering women. If we are truly concerned about the wellbeing of females then we need to work on changing the mindset of people.","Standing here today I wonder if we should even be asking this question? Should the UN recognise Islamic Emirates of Taliban ? NO ,INDUBITABLY without any hint of doubt NO. The United Nations was formed in 1945 after the horrors faced by the world during world war 2 , humanity at war with itself . The UN is a peacekeeping organization and Taliban rose to power by the means of hostilities and bloodshed.  Taliban authorities have imposed severe restrictions on women’s and girls’ rights, suppressed the media, and arbitrarily detained, tortured, and summarily executed critics and perceived opponents, among other abuses , which not only makes UN accepting Taliban hypocritical and against the core beliefs of the foundation but also in opposition to the fight and struggles the humankind has been putting to make world a more peaceful place for habitation. And I am sure the other worthy candidates must have pointed out that Taliban is just the people of Afghanistan taking control over from the west to inhabit an islamic nation but that doesn’t explain the rights they have stolen from women . the basic human rights , the equality the women have strived for , the identification that they have craved for so long , the respect that they deserved . Afghanistan has infamously become the first nation to deny women of higher education just because of their gender. The Taliban’s horrendous human rights record and their unwillingness to meaningfully engage with international financial institutions have furthered their isolation Many westerners interpret the Taliban’s lack of sophisticated ideological discourse as a lack of commitment. The fighters are basically farmers. Most of them are very young. Their world view is not very complex, but they certainly have one. It is a narrative of freedom from foreign forces. These values resonate deeply. In the world we witness today it is determined that peace be kept in between cast,creeds,genders,races and identities because when all is said and done we are the same vulnerable, fleshy creatures our kind defines as “humans” . i would like to end by saying that Taliban may no longer be a terrorist organization but it’s not humanly to take away someone’s rights to be human and unless The Islamic Emirates of Taliban agrees to it too they shall remain off track and erroneous  in the sights of the odds and ends and hence never be accepted a part of The United Nations",False

Recognising the Taliban would legitimise all the heinous dictatorships and autocratic regimes that have wreaked terror and destroyed lives all over history.The UN was created to prevent war and perpetuate peace both of which are in stark contrast with the Taliban.Furthermore, realistically speaking the Taliban has been at war with most of the UN security council and is diametrically opposed to western values and ideas of freedom and equality, this makes the recognition of Taliban by the UN virtually impossible.In a world where even the most orthodox nations such as Saudi Arabia are moving towards a freer and more modern governance a state like the Islamic Emirate of Taliban is a step backward and a loss not just for its own people but the entire world.The diverse tribes of Afghanistan cannot all be silenced by force and sooner or later freedom shall triumph even in the darkest of places.

And we know that progressive empowerment of women has been an important element of past century.

Empowering women comes with a guarantee to use monetary gains in a way that benefits the household like spending money on food wisely. Over time Women has been keen and more efficient in household works than men. This thing takes women even one step forward. Women can even do household chores and can simultaneously do outdoor works. This only empowers women and make them stronger. One of the Ava's songs say ""If all of the kings had their queens on the throne we would pop champagne and raise a toast"".

5,1,Twinkle Dhingra,"AGAINST THE MOTION 
It goes without saying that the word Feminism is associated with tempestuous stigma, and misunderstandings, and is often confused to exist as a proposition to female ascendancy. However, I would begin by stating that feminism truly signifies the prevalence of equal rights and opportunities for women and men alike. It revolves around women, first and foremost, having a choice and then the privilege to pursue them indiscriminately. 
Emphasizing on reclaiming domestic activities, which are preconceived to be the paramount obligation of women, would be counterproductive since the goal of feminism is to escape the age-old shackles of patriarchy, not reinforce them. 
The more effective course of action would be to challenge, and excel at, what is considered to be a male dominated sphere. The ideology behind feminism would be rendered obsolete if it was unable to sway people's mindset into accepting that women are competent, whether it comes to ascending the corporate ladder, running businesses, driving tractors, operating heavy machinery, nursing the sick, working the farms, or making a sale. This change in mindset, could in turn, open a passageway to countless new horizons and experiences for women through the world. Reclaiming domestic chores as empowering, however, might produce a contrasting result. 
Another aspect to be considered is that household activities are preponderantly expected of women and thus, taken for granted. It is often overlooked that they are requisites for survival, and functioning, and should be considered a responsibility of everyone in the family, regardless of the gender. 
 The discourse here is that, women lie between the devil and the deep sea. Behind them is the patriarchal system, the private house with its nullity, immorality, hypocrisy and servility. Before them lies the professional world with its hindrances, distress, challenges and jealousy. But I truly believe, that a woman, with abundance in opportunities, proficiency in the professional world, and a zeal for knowledge and influence, combined with her values, hand in hand with men, can result in the making of a new and better world. As Goethe once said,
  ""The woman in woman 
  Lead forward for ever"". 
","It is my firmly based conviction that the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirates of Taliban, as the recognition must be predicated on international communities’ norms including human rights, especially those of women and girls, representative governance, and international collective security. Taliban need to adhere to these international obligations as opposed to requesting recognition based on the fact that they have seized territorial control.  In fact, the UN should impose a moratorium on them for a limited time, to avoid condoning this unfolding anti-humanitarian situation. Its converse could have catastrophic implications and could set a dangerous precedence.
 Taliban has taken power by force, against the will of the people. Recognizing it will give due leverage to other extremists and fringe elements waiting to seize power by force, which will result in the annihilation of the voices of minorities and other at-risk groups. The Taliban has indulged in gross violation of human rights and thwarted attempts to solve issues via bilateral talks, posing a risk to states around it. The rogue regime can also be used as a puppet nation state by expansionist powers which would like to utilize the resources of a landlocked, but otherwise mineral rich country at the cost of its populace.
Rampant bigotry and terrorizing proclamations by the UN sanctioned leaders are nothing short of inhuman. Afghan women have to face harrowing conditions and live in extreme fear under hardline Islamist regime of Taliban. Their right to education and work have been curbed. Terrorist attacks on places of worship of minority community and the targeting of the innocent civilian population is condemnable. Drug trafficking is another menace for the region since Illicit drug traders and terrorists have a symbiotic relationship. 
However, it must be noted that it is in the interest of humanity to ensure the socio-economic upliftment of those living in Afghanistan. Recognizing the Taliban Regime with caveats may seem like pulling a rabbit out of a hat but it may just be worthwhile if it allows the UN to work in Afghanistan formally to ensure delivery of basic survival facilities to the local population.

Women’s Rights Posed to Further Deteriorate in Tunisia

Upcoming parliamentary elections have raised concerns about the erosion of women’s rights in Tunisia. A new election law, introduced by President Kais Saied in September, omits many of the country’s former gender parity provisions and makes it more challenging for women to run for elected office. As a result, this Saturday’s election will feature just 122 female candidates and 936 male candidates. “The Tunisian parliament was once the exemplar of gender equity in the region. With these new changes to the law, that could soon be history,” wrote Salsabil Chellali, Tunisia director at Human Right Watch.  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced concern over an “alarming erosion of democratic norms” in Tunisia. Almost all of Tunisia’s major parties are boycotting Saturday’s election.



The Taliban has ruled Afghanistan as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan since taking control by force in 2021, overthrowing the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The takeover was widely criticized by the international community, and no countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the new regime, despite nominally maintaining relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban has aggressively campaigned for international recognition since the takeover. Several countries have vowed never to recognize the Islamic Emirate, and others have said they will do so only if human rights are respected. Some countries have accredited Taliban diplomats at the chargé d'affaires level despite not recognizing the Islamic Emirate.

Only three countries—Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—ever recognized the Taliban as the country’s lawful government and, despite repeated efforts, it never gained control of Afghanistan’s UN seat, which remained in the hands of Rabbani supporters. The Taliban was ultimately displaced by the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. The United States and its allies then helped to install the democratically elected the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan government that controlled the country from 2001 to 2021. Both the United States and the broader international community recognized and restored full diplomatic relations with this government, including the exchange of embassies and ambassadors. This was the government that ultimately collapsed when President Ashraf Ghani fled in the face of a Taliban advance in August 2021, ceding control of the government back to the Taliban.",False
5,1,Tanisha sethi ,"I agree with the notion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities( such as gardening, cooking) as empowering because according to me there shouldn't be any pressure on women to do it regardless of their choice however, it doesn't mean one needs to resist against these activities in order to be called a feminist. Nurturing is a part of human nature and some women actually enjoy a lifestyle where they like doing domestic activities and stay away from the hussle and it is a completely personal choice but it is still OK if someone doesn't want to engage in domestic activities and want to be part of the work industry. The point I am trying to make is that no activity can be a factor that defines ones identity. To resist doing some activity even if you liked doing it in the first place just to call yourself a feminist is not a very logical approach to the issue. Domestic activities are important, at the end of the day one cannot survive without performing these activities. I will say it shouldn't be dictated by the stereotypes about who should do these activities but that doesn't mean doing these will make you weak. ","Given the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, I don't agree that UN should recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. Taliban has been very cruel and terrorisng towards the citizens of Afghanistan especially women. A lot of their rights have been taken from them and on the humanitarian base, things have got too worse. Recently, it was there on the news that women are now not allowed to attend universities for higher studies neither are they allowed to work which is really unjust. The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.The Taliban threaten Afghans’ civil and political rights written in the constitution created by the U.S.-backed government.The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations. The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down.

5,1,Aparna ,"When it comes to empowering the women we always talk about that we should give them equal opportunities to work in the corporate sector political sector or in any other field which has to be considered a field of men in earlier times .And over the time it has get a lot of success as we have got so many successful female CEOs , the great political leaders likely late  Sushma Swaraj ma'am , and how to forget the ideals of many the  Teena dabi ma'am , shrusti Deshmukh mam inspiration for almost all of the UPSC aspirants. As it Bring the social pride , prestige feminists always claim it and I am more than hundred percent sure that i support this but feminism doesn't means only that a women has to come out and to do the works that some how brings that social recognisation. Feminist should actively reclaimed the domestic activities like gardening cooking are  also symbol of a strong women as. As building something or cooking something  aur taking care of a child or washing clothes or utensils is not that easy or it's not that much a normal thing that it should not be recognised as the part of the feminism. This is also empowering whether a woman doing this activity either  as a home maker or doing it as a job of maid to earn the income.. both  working for 9 to 5 or doing domestic works both should be considered as an equally important. Feminist should try to change the mind set of the people  and make them realise that doing this works is not  the natural responsibility of a women so this should also be considered equal to the job and the women should be respected for this and get the same importance she got in the case she was doing the job  in corporate sector or any other field. This is important not only to make sure that all the women get the important and their place in the society but it is also important to keep the essence of the feminism because the feminism refers that every women should get the right she deserve and the respect pride and the dignity and involvement in the society and to be entitled for the she doesn't have to do any kind of 9 to 5 job and definitely according to me when we are excluding the domestic services from the concept of the jobs or the services that empower the women somehow we are creating the hypocrisy on our own concept when we are saying that the women deserve the respect then there should not be a criteria that the women should be in this kind of job earning that much or doing this  having any kind of a standard degree or anyother bullshit . Further doing this job as a homemaker may not have any kind of economic value  even in the present time but that doesn't efforts should not be done for this. We should try to make a step towards it instead of degrading the work. While inducing the concept of  feminism we should not forget that not all the fingers in the hands are equal but all the fingers I needed to make a strong faced so that is why the feminist should consider all the domestic activities as equally empowering ","From my point of view Taliban should not get recognisation from the UN. As it will definitely give the encouragement and indirectly support to the all the 
 terrorist organisations to increase their activities around the world and to simply take over some place and get the government and the world leaders to  do anything that they wish for. The beginning with just getting the recognisation and who knows the end will be but taking over that capitals of the  big countries like of America Russia and India or to make human trafficking legal for them . When we full fill the wish of someone just because they had got the some Power by any kind of protest  or any kind of revolution then definitely it encourages them  to take more and more step and definitely it is not something that world can afford either as a society as a  global economy . While taken seriously and handle with the lot of strictness America had cope up with the issue of the terrorism while India continuous to be a victim of a terrorism while  being so lenient over the terrorism on the names of the human rights and the so called panel discussions . That is more than enough to support the point that why we should not give the any kind of recognisation towards the Islamic emirates of The Taliban. Just like a coal always made black the hands which are holding it similarly organisation whose intentions were always negative can never fetch a land with the human beings that have the humanity. Just like a cultured family give the cultured children to the society similarly organisation who had always  try to make the teenagers into a terrorist it will definitely be a stupidnesss to believe that Taliban if getting supported will stop to do all kind of illegal activities across the borders or in the country.  And we all know that UN from the very beginning has always biased toward the countries  the leaders that have the power and have the influence over the world. So I don't thought it will take a lot time to get UN biased towards Taliban if  got recognised  ,the terrorist groups then we should stop mourning about the Taj hotel attack or the world trade organisations bomb blast. And definitely UN  is going to lose its essence then we don't have to discuss about the Russia Ukraine war we don't have it discuss about the Pakistan or Jammu Kashmir issue in it because if I Taliban can get the recognization then what is wrong in isi or tukde tukde gang and accordingly Pakistan is not doing something that should India should have problem they are just trying to take over a piece of land nothing more than that ..
So that some powerful countries can maintain their diplomatic relationships and can use the resources of Afghanistan that never implies that  terrorist organisation should get recognisation even though they become the Government of that country",False
5,1,Bihaan Chakraborty,"To start the discussion I feel like we need to understand the idea behind feminism or in general understand what feminist is. A feminist is someone who believes in feminism , feminism is not an idea but actually more of a movement , quite simply feminism is all about  genders having equal rights while respecting women when it comes to whatever they choose to pursue or follow in life. To be put into perspective , a woman should be able to do whatever a man is able to achieve in life , and no one has a say regarding the matter at hand. Feminism plays a great hand when it comes casual sexism , sexual exploitation or any kind of sexual domination in our day to day lives.
In households world wide , the women cook , clean , nurture for the sake of the family , in most of the cases this effort is overlooked , this effort is considered as your average task in day to day life but it is due to the diligence of a woman the family is able to function as a whole. In short these activities are important , more so a necessity but is overlooked as a second tier duty as usual as the men who provide for the family and are able to earn a living is considered to be the primary goal in most cases. Lets talk about how domestic activities are co related with empowerment in society. Empowerment refers to women having established complete control on their lives and actions , they have the right to make their own decisions in any filed and should not have to be discriminated for it. Empowerment means that people are equal citizens. When it comes being equal in a society setting ,it means being equal in social , economic and domestic spheres of life but we overlook the domestic factor as well. Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering . Domestic activities dictate the power struggle within a household , but can it contribute to feminism? 
Both women and men primed to feel relatively poor are more likely to support find that girls building their human capital and women engaging in domestic ventures which means that  the salience of inequality can prompt support for women’s economic participation. Support is not necessarily accompanied by increases in support for women having increased decision-making authority in their respective households. Women are more likely to express support for women’s participation in intra-household decision-making, the prime does not similarly alter men’s stated preferences regarding women’s participation in decision-making. .

","To understand the gravity of the situation , we must understand what exactly the Taliban is and what it exactly stands for. The Taliban is the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan , more so of a militant movement or power in this particular country. When it comes to the working of this emirate it includes resurgence , terrorist activity , coalition invasion , targeted killings , a resurgence , diplomatic negotiations , deals with the USA and imposing Islamic beliefs on the world. As of most recently , the Taliban overthrew the existing government in 2021 and imposed itself as the main authority in the country , this was due to all the military power the Taliban had backing itself. Th Taliban are also notorious when it comes subjugation against women , regarding education , marriage and their freedom in general. Following the Taliban's rise to power, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan's model of governance has been widely criticized by the international community, despite the government's repeated calls for international recognition and engagement. So this begs the question , should the UN approve it as a legit government body?
When it comes to the Taliban we know that this body makes all decisions that require some sort of military power , but as of the recent rise to power the government of Afghanistan  had lost all its ability to provide for its people , unlike the previous era where the government still could exercise its laws , the deterioration of the Afghan economy, and rising crime, are not yet at such levels as to signify the disintegration of Taliban authority, although it is still early days. All these factors may lead us to to believe that the Taliban authority may be fit to lead the country as it is. But the actual matter being that the people of this country  have lost their sense of freedom which leaves now growth of the country. It cannot be a successful cause with the people of its own country going against its country , its more of dictatorship than a government. As an unapproved government, the Taliban is treated as a state organ for the purpose of the law of state responsibility. Thus, its government is responsible for any breaches of Afghanistan’s obligations, and has a duty to cease violations and make reparation. As a successful insurgency, it is additionally responsible for its own past violations as an insurgent group, that is, before it became the government. Unless the people of the country are able to live peacefully & arent hesitant to grasp oppurtunites or exercise theirs rights without taking the government into consideration , the UN should not approve of this body.",False
5,1,Shiksha Nath ,"I totally disagree with the motion: “Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" 
Firstly, what exactly do we mean by domestic activities? Tasks performed inside household to ensure basic needs of members are met like Cooking, cleaning etc. where does the gender play role? Domestic activities are responsibilities for families that one does out of love and care. Just because women take up these responsibilities on a larger scale than men, we don’t name domestic activities as “feminine activities”.
The problem with the society is that we keep on following the customs made by our ancestors. Which also includes the tradition of female doing household work. Introducing such ideas will further deepen this culture and young women will not find any motivation to look beyond it and establish themselves.  
On the other hand, think about the men wanting to cook and clean for their families instead of earning. We usually think of them as failures and unwanted. We are also creating a society, where men have to be strong, protects etc and cannot express their feelings leading to depression. 
At last, I wish to claim is empowerment, either for men or women, is having power and control over their own lives. If earning money and spending it on yourself or being in power and having members working under you gives you the sense of freedom, you are empowered or if just doing household task makes you feel powerful and controlled, congratulations, you are empowered as well. Having the freedom to choose is empowerment. But, claiming a task or work as empowerment that to for only half of the section of the society is indeed a downfall. 




","According to me, UN should recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.
Its not about politics anymore instead the people and the people demand stability. The war is over. Taliban took over Afghanistan. Taliban are hard to defeat in a conventional war because of many reasons.
 Taliban have the support of the majority of the population, maybe not in Kabul but in the smaller cities and in the rural areas. Otherwise, they wouldn't have won the war.
Taliban are far less corrupted than the Western-backed government. The Taliban were ruling Afghanistan prior to 9/11 and nobody cared much about them until Usama Bin Laden, organized a terror attack on US. Taliban’s ideology have more legitimacy to rule the country than the West.
We can feel sorry about the fate of the pro-Western Afghans but we shouldn't forget that some of the United States' biggest allies have an equally abysmal human rights record than the Taliban.

5,1,Devatrai Jha ,"Feminism is not about pulling men down- it's about lifting women up. Since time immemorial, a division of labour has been prevalent across cultures, to better manage domestic and societal activities.
 However, it is with the forced assignment and rigid nature of such tasks that the whole concept of women ""abandoning"" their conventional duties springs. Women have never ""abandoned"" anything of that sort, and hence there is nothing we need to reclaim- they are proud mothers and daughters, housewives and professionals, and a lot of other things.
 Any domestic activity, when attached with economic value in the market, becomes a job that men often undertake- tailoring, gardening, cooking, etc. By the logic that feminist women should reclaim such tasks proudly, should we expect men to quit such jobs? 
I firmly believe that both sexes contribute to the household in their own ways, and erecting rigid walls to separate them would imply restricted teamwork, respect and understanding between the two. Hence, the question is not of women reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, but that of men realising that they have an equal share in said tasks. 
Pink and blue are just colours. Cooking and cleaning our just chores. 
Besides, it is the lionesses in a pride that hunt! ","A nation and its government's true recognition comes not from an international community like UN alone, but also from its own people. Considering the state of things, and the civil unrest and brulality that comprise the pillars of Taliban's ""right to rule"", we must realise that a nation being accepted as such is hard to define in a geopolitically eruptive world, such as the current one, where information is power and influence.
 A dictatorship like North Korea is recognised, a military coup like Pakistan is recognised, so what stops UN from recognising another military takeover like Taliban? It certainly can't be human rights, considering cases like China and many more.
How one can even think of seeking international approval to be called a legal government, despite flogging all modern concepts of peace, human rights and democracy, is beyond fundamental understanding. Why should an international community like UN, one that constantly seeks to press for global peace, demilitarisation, democracy and human rights, grant such a status to a group of people who think, for instance, that women shouldn't be educated, let alone be part of the government? Oh, because they totally do not make up half of humanity, do not run the house, and do not have brains well equipped enough to vote or be voted for, obviously. Love that argument. 
Spoiler, it's not UN. It is the people. Murder, brutality, crimes against humanity, and the many perils Afghani people are subject to every day, from curbing women's rights to tainting the Holy Quran, make it THEIR decision. It is their nation after all, and their lives that are directly affected and shaped by such political proceedings. If the people do not take Taliban as their own, under their free will, devoid of a gunpoint aimed at their heads, then no organisation can ever declare Afghanistan to be the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

In the past, they did it because it was their contribution to maintaining the home if they were not working and they had the time for it and the man had less time because he was working.

Why would anyone want to do the dishes?
Why would anyone want to dust the shelves?
Why would anyone want the onerous task of laundry?
No one would opt for these unless it was for their own personal upkeep. The only reason one would choose to do these life-maintenance tasks for others is if it was a job that came with payment or perks.

That’s why it’s a travesty of justice when tasks that no one would opt for are thrust on one section of the population who are gaslighted into believing it is their ‘duty’. In the above cases, these duties are left to the woman of the house. If a man does any of them, he is hailed as a noble soul, a selfless bodhisattva. As if he has never had any need for laundered clothes, cooked meals, a clean home, and the kids aren’t his.
No matter what a woman’s choice, inclination, ability, education, employment, or financial or social status, tending to the home and family almost always falls in her kitty.
Let’s get this straight. Housework is not a woman’s job. It’s not her choice, her calling, or her dharma. She did not opt for it. She was not born to do it. She does not want to spend decades of her life doing it. It’s not her burden or her cross to bear.
","In August 2021, the Taliban took control of Afghanistan once again. It marked the end of 20 years of relatively democratic governance in Afghanistan. Since then, the Taliban have portrayed their government as legitimate in hopes of attracting international recognition and occupying Afghanistan’s seat in the United Nations. 
On a humanitarian basis, the Taliban should not get the recognition of the UN. Even on Saturday, the statement issued by the UN spokesperson went on the note that the United Nations and its partners, including national and international NGOs, are helping more than 28 million Afghans who depend on humanitarian aid to survive. Possible recognition of the Taliban by the United Nations and other states would undermine some important principles of international law and have serious domestic and international implications. While the Taliban’s recognition would domestically undermine the right to self-determination of Afghans
From 1996 to 2001, Afghanistan received limited diplomatic recognition, with the United Nations and most countries continuing to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan, which the Taliban had reduced to a rump state. Taliban have serious legitimacy predicaments both internally and externally. 
The problem in gaining recognition of the UN by the Taliban is in two folds; first, the effective control doctrine is neither sufficient nor even the principal condition for recognition or obtaining a seat in the U.N. Traditionally, international recognition requires meeting four conditions by a new government: (1) effective control; (2) popular support and domestic legitimacy; (3) permanency and stability; and (4) ability and willingness to fulfill international obligations. Secondly, the Taliban fall way short of internal legitimacy by any metric. Taliban will only stand with little chance to achieve the recognition of the UN only when they put efforts to build up and professionalize the Afghan National Police, address opium production, should support elections, and provide humanitarian assistance to Afghans in need.

Although feminism has brought a huge difference in the outlook of women, it has turned some people against learning skills required in domestic activities. Masses have got an impression that carrying out regular domestic activities such as cooking and gardening drives us away from the very essence of feminism. For overall development, one requires to be good at least, if not perfect, in the majority of life skills. It should be emphasized that if a woman needs to learn to drive then she needs to learn cooking too, not because she is a woman but because she is a human. In the current scenario, a woman needs to be financially independent but at the same time she needs to ensure that she is not dependent on anyone for her day-to-day chores. Activities like cooking, baking and gardening are some of the many essential skills required in everyday activities, so they need to be promoted.

To encourage more and more women to come forward and to enable them to take charge of their lives in true sense, feminists definitely need to reclaim domestic activities as empowering. This would definitely prepare women to face any kind of situations they come across in their lives.","The Islamic Emirates of Taliban, a terrorist organisation took over the Government of Afghanistan in May 2021. The organisation attacked the capital, Kabul and forcefully took over the administration. This incident was condemned by all the countries which itself depicts that this overtaking of government forcefully was totally wrong. Since then, the world has been divided into two sects: one which does not recognise The Taliban as the ruling government and one which feels that recognising the Taliban government as official government would be beneficial for the Afghans. The UN security council has clearly stated that they don't recognise the Taliban government as neither did the contest the elections nor do they have a permanent head. They declared that recognising them would promote other terrorist organisations to take over the official governments in other countries and ultimately this would harm world peace. 
The Taliban government consists of blacklisted terrorist as their officials. Also, their government does not acknowledge the contribution of women in the society and has no female representatives in the government. Ever since they took over the control of the country all sections of the society have been affected negatively which is the biggest failure of a government. The people in Afghanistan are suffering from poverty, hunger, lack of education and an overall internal disturbance. All this acts as a proof in support of the statement that Taliban government does not deserve to be recognised. The most vital responsibility of a government is to look after the welfare of the citizens but the Taliban government has rendered the Afghans poor and helpless. Therefore, it can be concluded that the UN must not recognise the Taliban government. It will not only set a wrong example but also threaten international peace and harmony.

5,1,Pratham Bhushan Ghiloria,"I would like to share my view against the motion of the topic that ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" 
First of all, this is a direct attack on all the people who support feminism by saying feminist should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. This doesn’t even make sense to say that feminists should do domestic activities for the empowerment, 
If anyone want to do cooking, gardening etc. then go for it, doesn’t necessarily mean that these are only meant for the feminists. Feminists are the people who supports the idea of equal rights for the women, also there is no point for the feminists to participate in domestic activities for the empowerment. 
Feminism is not just for women, and men can absolutely be feminists too. This is because gender equality is not just a women’s issue, but a problem for all of society. Standards of masculinity and femininity can be damaging for everyone, and everyone benefits from having a more balanced, equal and representative society. Now , time has come to shift this paradigm. It will help in shaping future of new generation by bringing equality for women and men. The youth have to come forward and have to take the command/torch in their hand to bring above essential changes in to the society. It must be be inbuilt in our education system , that we have to give equal opportunities for men and women and have to bring gender equality.  ","I strongly oppose to if UN recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. The mindset that Taliban carry cannot advantageous for the country. They have stereotypical thinking, hence not allowing any women to go outside the house, to get educated. Taliban don’t understand the meaning of democracy, they are ruling the country as a dictator, like it’s their property and not thinking of any well being of the people in the country nor have any plan for the building of the nation’s infrastructure or it’s future plan for development. In the rule of Taliban basic fundamental rights of the human being are not getting respected or fulfilled but in democratic countries these are the necessity for living a good life. 

The most important thing and for the better future for the country is to provide quality to their people, but this idea is not supported by the Taliban government. The mindset that the government carry is terrorist mindset which will not help them to develop diplomatic nation with the any other country across the globe. Also, this will affect the youth and the coming generation of the nation resulting in bad consequences in the future.

Nowadays, most of the countries are liberalising the use of Hijab but they are forcing the women of the country to follow the rule without knowing their will. The UN should not recognise Islamic Emirate of Taliban as it will bring wrong practices in other islamic countries.",False

5,1,Anurag Singh,"I find this topic interesting and I am speaking against it. The reason for this is that speaking in favour of this topic is easy and the majority are already speaking in favour of it.

I am against the motion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. While I believe in gender equality and the empowerment of women, I do not think that reclaiming domestic activities is the way to achieve this.
Domestic activities, such as gardening and cooking, have traditionally been associated with the oppression and devaluation of women. These activities have often been considered the domain of women, while men have been expected to engage in paid work outside the home. This has contributed to the unequal distribution of domestic labour within households and to the societal devaluation of domestic work.
By actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists risk reinforcing harmful gender roles and expectations. It is important to recognize that these activities have been used as a means of controlling and oppressing women, and that reclaiming them as empowering does not necessarily challenge or change this.
Furthermore, I believe that there are more pressing issues for feminists to focus on. There are many other ways in which feminists can work towards the empowerment of women, such as fighting for equal pay and opportunities, challenging gender-based violence, and advocating for reproductive rights. These issues have a more significant impact on the lives of women and should be prioritized over domestic activities.
Overall, while I support the empowerment of women, I do not think that reclaiming domestic activities is the most effective or meaningful way to achieve this. There are many other important issues that feminists should focus on, and I believe that these should be prioritized over domestic activities.","The situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is indeed a perilous one, and it has been a source of concern for many people around the world. There are many factors that have contributed to the rise of illegal activities at the border, including economic, social, and political conditions in both the United States and Mexico.
One major factor that has contributed to the rise of illegal activities at the border is the lack of legal channels for immigrants to enter the United States. Many immigrants, particularly those from Central and South America, are fleeing poverty, violence, and political instability in their home countries and are seeking a better life in the United States. However, the U.S. immigration system is often unable to accommodate the high demand for visas and other legal means of entry, leaving many immigrants with no choice but to turn to illegal channels.
The illegal crossing of the border has also been facilitated by criminal organizations that profit from the smuggling of people and goods. These organizations often engage in a variety of illegal activities, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, and other forms of organized crime, which can have serious negative impacts on both the United States and Mexico.
To address the problem of illegal immigration at the border, it is important to address the root causes that drive people to leave their homes and seek a better life in the United States. This may include addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and political instability in the countries of origin, as well as improving the legal channels for immigration and seeking to reduce the demand for illegal services. It may also involve working with Mexico and other countries in the region to address the problem of transnational criminal organizations and to provide assistance to those who are most vulnerable.",Maybe
5,1,Khushi Verma,"I agree with the idea that Feminist should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering, also if we're reclaiming household and domestic activities it needs to be done by both men and women. 

Although it depends on our fields of interest and decisions but practicing domestic chores like gardening,  stitching, cooking will not only help us explore and learn new things but help us becoming independent and a  better version of yourselves.

But nowadays the definition of Feminism has been moulded by men and women especially by the new generation. Feminism was never to degrade practicing domestic chores and only earning money. It was never about women doing men’s job, never about berating men, never about empowering a particular occupation or activity, Feminism was about the joy or the ability to make our own decisions without being judged with the freedom that men have had all these years. Feminism is about fighting for everyone, not just women. Its about getting equal opportunities and chances irrespective of our gender. Its about doing what we love without being questioned by the society (it could be either me being a housemaker or CEO of a company). Still there are companies in our country which offer different salaries to women and men at the same post, parents who educate their boys but not their girls, companies hiring married males but not married females. Feminism is about removing this gap of opportunities.

I will conclude by stating that it’s not our work which makes us empowering but it’s our mentality, attitude towards life, ideology which does.

No, I completely disagree with the idea that UN should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as the government of Afghanistan considering the rules and regulations implemented by the community reflecting it as a backward, orthodox society and its unethical, brutal and harsh attitude towards the citizens of the country. As per the news UN has sent  a strong message to the Taliban that the world body will not recognize it without respect for human rights, including for women, girls, and minorities.

The takeover of the government has left the country in economic, humanitarian, and human rights crises. Afghanistan is amongst the most hungry countries of the world with more than 20 million people to face acute hunger by 2023.

Women and girls have been deprived of their rights, including the right to education, and disappeared from the public under Taliban rule. The Taliban's latest ban on women prevents them from using gyms and entering parks. Thousands of women have since lost their jobs or were forced to resign from government institutions and the private sector. Girls have been prevented from attending middle and high school. 

The Taliban takeover has also increased the number of Afghan refugees entering neighboring countries. After sealing of the airways citizens travelled by road to Pakistan and Iran resulting in thousands of refugees gathering at the borders of the respective countries.
The current situation of Afghanistan reflects that Taliban as a recognized power will be an absolute failure.
Living in the 21st century, promoting and encouraging Feminism and LGBT community, protesting against child labour and sexual harassment, UN recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as the government for a long run will be a battle the world lost , which we couldn’t afford.

This opinion can spread fastly among the Youth if necessary steps aren't taken as soon as possible. Awareness about this among the Youth is the need of the hour.

The Taliban has ruled Afghanistan as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan since taking force by control in 2021, overthrowing the internationally recognized Islamic Republic Of Afghanistan. The takeover was widely criticized by the international community, and no countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the new regime, despite nominally maintaining relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban has aggressively campaigned for international recognition since the takeover. Several countries have vowed never to recognize the Islamic Emirate, and others have said they will do so only if human rights are respected. Some countries have accredited Taliban diplomats at the chargé d'affaires level despite not recognizing the Islamic Emirate.
The ties between the Taliban and those international terrorist groups are stronger today than in recent times. The Taliban did not sever its ties with regional and international terrorist organizations, despite its commitments under the Doha Agreement.
Their links to drugs, smuggling, and looting of Afghanistan’s natural resources are unprecedented, and those who encourage and participate in them are certainly beneficiaries. Therefore, it is not a civil war, but a war of criminal and terrorist networks fought on the backs of Afghans. Importantly, the Taliban is getting logistics, war equipment supplies, and a haven from Pakistan. So, I don't find any reason for the UN to recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban.",False
5,1,Maitreyi atri,"Feminists should not be forced to reclaim domestic activities such as cleaning,cooking,gardening as empowering because empowerment comes from within and can’t be forced onto someone by mere acts. These activities aren’t performed just for the sake of doing but also  represent a way of doing what one loves. These acts should be an individual’s choice and according to his or her own preference rather than being a depraved  propaganda to influence the minds of the upcoming generations and to increase the disparity between the genders. 
Just like the great playwright William Shakespeare once wrote “expectations are the root cause of all heartaches” one should not be obligated to perform basic activities like gardening,cooking and cleaning just because they are feminists. Instead of tagging these activities to be performed by a certain group of people and to stop categorising  them further , we should be creating a space where people enjoy and feel safe to take up the same irrespective of their genders. They should  independently express themselves through these small acts which when done from will lead to wonderful outcomes. Nowadays, we can see the family dynamics changing wherein the women are joining defence forces and their male counterparts supporting the family by doing the household activities. Mitali Madhumita and Punita Arora being examples for the same highlights how we can’t associate basic activities of the household like cleaning and looking out for children as feminine acts. 
Moreover us seeing Gabriel the lead in Emily in Paris being a chef and owning a restaurant without being forced to do the same just because he’s a feminist signifies how simple acts when done with consent and without pressurisation and stress promote not just the individual but the society as a whole. ","I would like to start off my  speech with a popular saying ,”to win something, you have to lose something”. According to me, the UN recognising the Islamic Emirate Of Taliban might be a boon for the countrymen.With the help of UN,the harsh rules that have cracked down on women’s rights and basic services can return back to normal.The country with a population of 3.98 crore is struggling to even form a functioning government that can provide health services and economic opportunities to afghans. All this can be averted if the state is recognised by the United Nations. With its supervision and strict guidelines the numerous human rights violations documented, the restricted press freedom and obliterated women rights can all be checked for and corrected. Without the recognition by the higher authorities,the girls will be prohibited from attending secondary schools and working across the country till it all takes a dark toll for the country’s future. The afghan’s standards of living over the two decades if left alone and unaccounted for would be pushed into the dark and would put the country back to the Stone Age era. The world is a global village and hence it is the need of the hour for us to not leave our fellow afghans suffering from not only food insecurity but also political and social crisis. The UN intervention can help not  only Afghanistan but also the entire world to protect human rights and ensure international peace and security. Moreover this would help the state supporting sustainable development and providing opportunities for social and economic growth. With its humanitarian Aids, the children forced to stay home , can finally exercise their right to education and livelihood. This would help the entire dynamics of the country because indirectly it will also open trade passage and union rules, thereby strengthening the economic condition of the country. If we think that by leaving the state unrecognised by UN can possibly be the right move , then we are miserably failing our brothers and sisters and destroying the young minds which would be infiltrated by militant ideas if not cared for now.

A couple decades earlier , I would have opposed for the same motion , as the women did face inequality in all domains of life. But the feminist movement is running for a long time, things have improved a lot . In many places , women have come equal to men or even left them behind . Government also have been actively working hard for the upliftment of the women .  Their policies really did benefit women. 
Those policies emphasized on girl education , from elementary to post graduation level . literacy rate among women , though inferior to men, still improved by a good chunk. Women are performing well and providing tough competition to their male compartment, whether in board exams or placement interviews .
The women used to be stereotyped to be gentle ,sensitive. They were trained to perform domestic chores from the childhood.  There is nothing wrong in that. It’s the ideology behind that needs the changing.  The feminine considered the weaker sex , not suitable for field jobs  and other arguments of the patriarchal society.
To break through this society , women increased participation in jobs, becoming earning members of the family.
Though having numerous pros, there are few cons that are need to lookafter. If all women went to work outside, unemployment rate going to rocketed high . Forget that, if all women went to work, who are at home now , to watch after the kids ,the old parents who need taken care of. Without them , the concept of family is non-existent .The women participation in domestic chores and looking after the children and old age members of he family ,allowed men freely to go out for work , earn money to fulfill the needs of his family.

5,1,Dipty Singh ,"I believe feminist should reclaim domestic activities as empowering. Domestic activities such as gardening and cooking are important life skills. I strongly believe that everyone irrespective of gender or the social movement they support must learn these skills. They can also act as great stress busters. Although not everyone agrees with this.

Domestic work ,in general, is regard with distaste. The workers are treated as servants and their work is not considered dignified. Society needs to change this opinion and feminism is an activist movement focused on bringing equality. As feminists, we should actively take pride in doing our part in a household and also encourage others to respect and contribute in the household activities. There are housewives doing these chores for free (and never thanked for it) and there are helpers poorly paid working in bad conditions.

There is a lot of domestic work that need to be taken care of in a home. Someone with a logical, rational and active mindset can only handle all the work and also continue their life peacefully . Things like meal planning, dishes and cleaning need to be daily while others like paying bills and filling tax forms need to be done occasionally. They require hard work, dedication and utmost discipline. We should be grateful for the people doing these chores for us.

Activities like washing clothes, cleaning the house, cooking meals, etc provide living wages for the people in the weaker sections of the society. It also helps them reclaim financial control of their life and support their families. Unpaid care and domestic work has been estimated to be as much as 9 percent of global GDP (USD 11 trillion) by the International Labour Organization (ILO).

Women, for decades, have been doing these chores and also living an active social and work life. They manage household, kids and their job. Domestic activities indeed are a Herculean task but instead of being grateful for their contribution, domestic workers are looked down upon. We need to reclaim this as empowering and we need to do it NOW.","UN should not recognise the islamic Emirates of Taliban. This will have major disastrous affect on world peace and global economy.

If recognition is given, many other terrorist organisation would also demand recognition for eg: The Taliban in Pakistan, and Baluchistan. Many smaller terrorist groups will try to capture big enough territories so that they can also be recognised as governing body. This will need to unrest and riots.

Taliban has completed removed women's access to human rights. It has also shut down courts that judged and prosecuted crimes against women. Innocent civilians have to endure humiliating condition, torture and inhuman conditions. If Taliban is given recognition, these crimes will only increase.

Afganistan would become a breeding ground for terrorism. Taliban and other such organisation could freely and fearlessly train and group in Afganistan. History can repeat itself if UN recognise the Islamic Emirates of Taliban.Back in 19th century when Taliban took over Afganistan in the past, terrorism found a home to hide and grow. If the world is to be freed of this horror, UN should never accept Taliban.

Recognitions of Taliban would be problematic for the world economy too. Taliban would force opium cultivation to promote it's economy. This would be harmful for the youth and the theird world countries. Opium is easier to sell in the Black market. And giving recognition to Taliban would make Afghanistan an open Black market. They buy their weapons and machines from the black market and sell children and women into slavery. It would also increase back door gold trading and money laundering.

Taliban believes in Sharia law. This law contradicts many human rights and fundamental rights. Under this law, male dominance is promoted and women are treated as secondary citizens. It is against female education and bans music, art and any form of entertainment.

3,0,Dhruv Agarwal,"For the motion:
According to my knowledge feminism means equality between men and women but nowadays people have misunderstood this and converted it to not doing domestic activities. Rather than men taking up and realizing the importance of domestic works, women have also stopped doing domestic works. I certainly support feminism but an effort should also be made to uplift or to normalize domestic activities. It should be made to understand that domestic activities are as valuable as working in a professional setup. In order to achieve the true equality a conscious effort need to be put in this direction. This can be achieved by the help of feminists whether, male or female, trying to show the world the importance of this. The discriminating or the double standard mentality needs to be stopped and an equal mindset needs to be brought in and this can be achieved by the beginning through feminists. This topic is a really sensitive topic but indeed a very important one. Through this note I would also like to discuss the importance of feminism and why is it needed. The prime reason why all this started is because of the history. Women in our history have had to face a lot of challenges and were made to look inferior and had even started to think themselves as inferior, but feminism is something that gave them the identity, confidence and the self belief that they are not inferior at all. Then why is it still needed? The answer is that even today equalization between men and women have not been accepted by certain sections of society. But as we always say that too much of anything can be hazardous, so their should be a limit to the extent of feminism just like the example above regarding domestic activities. This will all get equal the day we all start seeing each other as humans and not male or female. On that note Thank You!

Secondly this government is not a government but a terrorist organization as we all are aware of. In my opinion the UN should not recognize the Islamic Republic of Taliban as their motto is to spread terrorism.

5,1,Aakarsh Rana,"AGAINST:

Gordon Ramsay, Yannick Alleno, Sanjeev Kapoor, Ranveer Brar, these are the names which instantly come to people’s minds when asked about top chefs. Surprisingly, all the chefs mentioned above are men. In fact, at least in the Indian context, on every occasion whether it is religious, cultural or wedding parties, a large percentage of cooks are men; what does it prove? Would men claim it as empowering? To further elaborate my point, I shall take the stance against the idea that it is empowering for feminists to ‘reclaim’ domestic activities.

Feminists have been trying to spread awareness that it is not just the household chores, gardening, washing clothes and cooking to which their names should be associated but also politics, sports and other areas. Reclaiming domestic activities at this stage would, in a sense, mean that they have not been successful in gaining equal rights in other fields and are hence forced to descend to the same level from where they started their journey from.

‘Reclamation’ of domestic activities by feminists essentially implies that household activities are feminine and are the responsibility of women. For decades, feminists have been attempting to remove the strict division created by ideologues such as Rousseau, between a public sphere strictly dominated by men and a private sphere constituted of women and children.  It’s also significant to point out that, contrary to common perception, feminists do not just constitute women but men as well, indeed all who believe in equality of sexes. How is then the domestic sphere an area to be reclaimed? It may be rather considered a taunt to women that it is the domestic space they have always belonged to and should be using domestic activities as an empowering tool. 

In this age and time, it is of utmost importance to destroy the sexual division of labour and emphasize the need to balance work and home by men as well as women. Long gone are the days of having one ‘breadwinner’ and one ‘caretaker’ in a household. With modernisation and progression of society, the need for shared responsibility has become pertinent.

With this I rest my case. 
 

","The government in Afghanistan had been running with the support of international, particularly U.S aid. When the Western countries realised that they were no longer getting a net profit out of their, what may be called ‘occupation’ of the country, the U.S and NATO withdrew all international troops, leading to a collapse of the elected government and creating a power vacuum; this opportunity was seized by the Taliban in August 2022, coming to power once again after 2001. 

The Islamic Emirate of Taliban has been recognised by only three countries till now- Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Under International law, an entity qualifies as the government if it effectively, independently and durably controls the state’s territory, its authority is recognised (but not necessarily supported) by the population, and there is no rival effective authority. This is the case even if the entity came to power unconstitutionally, and even if it is not democratic or does not respect human rights. 

The only bars on a country being accepted as a government are where the United Nations Security Council declares that a situation is illegal and must not be recognised; or where a government has come to power through illegal use of force by a foreign state or denial of self-determination. In the absence of these conditions, the UN is indeed on a gradual path of recognition of the Taliban regime. 

The gross human rights violations of the regime are quite well known, and it’s often argued that UN recognition would further validate these atrocities. However, it’s important to understand that foreign recognition would eventually force the Islamic Emirate to act in accordance with international principles and decrees such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore, denying recognition to the new Taliban government would not only alienate the ruling tyrants but also the innocent population, hanging them out to dry. Recognition by the UN, thus, offers them a tiny glimpse of hope in a world where all has been taken away from them

5,1,Avantika Ambra,"The feminist concept begins with the belief that women are in a position of inferiority and inferiority compared to men. Feminist ideology is mainly concerned with gender discrimination and it is concerned with oppression and rights. This concept focuses on the subjugation of living beings and the measures to redress them while focusing on the injustice done to them.

They believe that the reason for the inferiority of women is artificial and it is constructed by the society which should be challenged. But when it comes to domestic activities they tend to retrace their steps, considering domestic activities unprofessional and unproductive. India is largely a country of poor uneducated people where if domestic activities won't be considered as empowering then it'd be so difficult to start to better India or even visualise it. Starting off where you belong to is the basis of any foundation to stand for a longer period. 

Historically, feminist issues demand that women's rights be recognized as a general category of human rights and equality of men and women be accepted in the context of the entire social life. Having said that, domestic activities should be actively done by men as well, but their patriarchal denial makes it something which is unrecognizable and thus domestic activities have always been taken for granted. Following which popularised feminist discourse has devalued doing daily household chores and implicitly defined it as work that reinforces women’s second-class status and tags them ""house wives"" which nonetheless signifies to being unproductive. In an era of climate change linked to industrialised foods and disease epidemics caused by the modern Western diet, domestic work has acquired political importance. Domestic activities must be understood as public, as well as private and should be considered as much as any other activity. Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering. ","The southwestern States that share a border with Mexico–Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California -- are put under strain when they must process illegal immigrants caught with illegal drugs. Illegal immigrants arrested for drug smuggling are not deported, rather they are processed through the local criminal justice system. They are also rarely transferred to the Federal justice system because most are caught with amounts of illegal drugs that are below the unofficial threshold for Federal involvement. Once in custody, local tax money must pay for any medical services, autopsies, or burials that are necessary in the care of the illegal immigrant. As such, border States are under increasing financial strain to support the influx of illegal immigrants that must be processed through the criminal justice system. This study examined two research questions: (1) How does providing law enforcement, criminal justice, and emergency medical services to illegal immigrants affect the workload of each county department in the border States, and (2) what are the financial costs? Site visits were conducted in each county between February 2000 and December 2000. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders and documents concerning county budgets, U.S. Census data, INS border crossing data, Border Patrol apprehension data, newspaper accounts, public documents, and public testimony in congressional hearings were analyzed. Results indicated that the total cost to border counties was approximately $108.2 million in fiscal year 1999. The two California counties carried most of the cost, over 50 percent of the total; however, when measured on a per capita basis, the smallest and poorest counties had the highest financial burden. Over half of New Mexico’s public safety budget in 1999 was spent on criminal illegal immigrants. Emergency medical services cost the 24 counties $19.1 million in fiscal year 1999. Findings should assist lawmakers in designing legislation that would shift the costs of criminal illegal immigrants from the county governments to the Federal Government.

5,1,Akshata Chopra ,"I present my arguments for the motion. Domestic activities like cooking, gardening etc. are skills that do not bind or enslave you but rather make you self-sufficient and powerful. Rather, nowadays, it is quintessential for us to know basic household chores for our survival. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit and house helps were not allowed, it disrupted the traditional division of labor. The burden of the entire housework was necessitated to be equally divided between the male and female counterparts of the house. As a matter of fact, the lockdown actually highlighted the empowering nature of the above-mentioned domestic activities.
Moreover, for a lot of people, men and women alike, chores like such, act as therapeutic and relaxing, so I don't believe that the lack of these domestic skills is in any way empowering, as many ""modern"" feminists might claim. Though feminism condemns relegating women to only households, nowhere does the fundamental concept of feminism bind women or men to only earning money or just focusing on money-rewarding activities and becoming financially independent, and thus, most basic things like domestic chores should also be given attention.
Also, an equal division of labor between the male and female counterparts of the house is one of the best and most effective ways to eradicate patriarchy's inviolable model of ""male breadwinner and female homemaker"".","I believe that the situation of the immigrants between the US-Mexico border was far better before the Trump administration invoked ""Title 42"" and worsened the circumstances. As Title 42 expels asylum seekers without even giving their case a fair and legal trial, the tension among the immigrants is turning hostile and, as a result, the crime rates at the border are increasing. This decision not only adversely affected the immigrants but also posed problems for the border police as now many people were trying to enter the country illegally. This also increased the crime rates in both countries. Illicit activities like drug trafficking and money laundering have also gone up extensively. Moreover, the increased influx of undocumented residents poses accommodation and job issues for the natives as well, which is crashing the economy of the US. Besides, there isn't enough legal protection for, the undocumented immigrants which makes them feel as unsafe in the country they seek refuge as in their own country. These refugees who are fleeing economic hardship, gang violence and political turmoil in their home countries deserve a fair hearing in their case on the basis of which their period of stay can be decided. I suggest the government of the USA pass an all-inclusive bill that would provide a path for the legalization of these people and provide them with a temporary accommodation and job whilst enforcing stronger border security provisions. I urge the authorities to administer a reformed, humane and comprehensive immigration system to put an end to this brewing humanitarian crisis.",False
5,1,Joveya Srivastava,"""Feminism should actively reclaim domestic activities(such as gardening,cooking) as empowering.""
In my definition, feminism is a fight for equal rights for both men and women. it doesn't aim to propel one gender ahead of the other but just the necessary equal footing women so need compared to men. With prevailing demons of witch hunt, lower wage, sexual predation and societal injustice towards women folk, feminism is ever raging as it should .Among all these, domestic labor draws its significant share of controversy over its non conformity about white and black totality of claim by the community. Should we or should we not reclaim remains the perpetual question. In coming days, the society has come to equate domestic activity by women to suppression. Any women who busies herself within the walls of household, whether or not by choice, is picketed to be victim of gender disparity. I cannot agree with this ideology.
Domestic activities in themselves should not be the basis to empower or denounce the feminist movement . One should see domestic work to be a mere necessity each gender should know how to perform for one's own needs or recreation. A woman could do gardening and cooking just as another passing bustle, a warm gesture for family or self pleasure and not necessarily because someone forced her to it. A happenstance  needn't be validated towards or against feminism. Happy homemaker is a thing for many. But  taking back up domestic activities as a technicality and going back to ""primitive situationships"" just for the sake of it won't validate the movement in any way. Why should women specifically touch upon the area of domestic activity anyways if the same question doesn't arise for men. And even as we do, domestic performance for the mere rebel show would never contribute to the upliftment of women. How can it, afterall? What is to gain or realize from doing household chores from the context of feminism. As she obsesses over the stove, does she have a third eye to simultaneously see how women are being paid less than their male counterparts at a professional workspace, and that they might get molested on their way home or that she might be poked about and constantly judged on what she wore when she went out, with whom she went out and when she came back? Can she fight back for women out there who go through this as she sweeps the floor just to put a label on feminism: hey there, welcome to the domestic activity chapter<chuckle>?! NO. And that's about it. Why don't we talk about men ""claiming"" domestic work as a first to fall back in place with the millions of women who have no choice but to do it because of familial priorities or lack of self-realization. The talk about women folk ""reclaiming"" it is a flawed, misogynist concept in itself. Cooking, cleaning and organising one's home will always help an individual to improve upon life and live life independently at one's own will but not because doing it will change the way society perceives women or give them equal opportunities. People need to draw clear lines over what feminism really stands for and how we can sensibly contribute to the movement.","The widely dreaded Taliban recently annexed Afghanistan to re-establish their tyrant supremacy once again. With the return of their government, stringent and draconian norms are the new normal. The Taliban denies numerous basic rights to Afghans and is particularly resenting of women empowerment. Unjust policies have been imposed for many minority groups as well. The Taliban continues denial to change and remains ever persistent with their unrelenting and severe interpretation of the Islamic Law. Since their ousting by the U.S. troops years back, the Taliban and U.S and associated organizations have looked daggers at each other's way. Until now, as a newly ""functional"" government the Taliban struggles to even provide the basic human rights to Afghans. It has forcibly obliterated press freedom, schooling of girl child and job opportunities for women folk among many more necessities, rendering the citizens to a stifled bare sustenance. Such an inept authority is harmful for any nation and will only ever remain incapable to propel Afghanistan to development, if not subjected to a change of ways. Given Taliban's moons old pattern of pledging and then breaching of trust, we cannot expect change,  atleast not one anytime soon and anytime soon might as well mean forevermore. Any government that threatens and violates rights of its subjects needs to be overthrown. If the UN recognizes the Islamic Emirate of Taliban it would mean a truce extended to the wrongful and fuel their raging deviousness. Invalidating their existence by ostracization from the U.N. would be insurgence. The U.N. can choose to do this until the Taliban accepts to the conditions of relaxing its ruthless realm. If it doesn't, the Taliban can remain the pariah, conflicted with the strongest of the nations in tandem and suffering the outcomes that come with the exclusion which they must know they cannot afford to bear for long. No organisation as big as as a government can survive on sparse relations with neighbouring nations and the Taliban is no exception to that. The U.N. shouldn't yield to anything lesser than this in order to end the brutality of the Taliban chapter for once and for all. Until then we can only hope that both sides keep the dealings peaceful for the good of humankind, which they so forget in the face of immense power time and again.",False
5,1,Ishita srivastava,"A feminist is someone who fully believes in the equality of women amongst all other genders. Since this is an umbrella term for people of all genders including men, i do fully support the statement. Domestic skills only prove to be powering and individualistic and makes a person independent. We shouldn’t look at the domestic chores with a derogatory gaze as they are not the bane of the existence of women. The root evils are gender roles. Women are equally as equipped with intellect and management skills as men are and it is nature’s assertion for every human to exhibit a domestic side to themselves as clearly visible by the presence of domestic requirements of each human. And if nature says so, who are we to question nature?
Resting the pressure of the homely duties on a woman’s shoulders is something i consider extremely low. Students all over the globe love away from their families and when life demands these domestic skills from them, they have no choice but to show up for themselves. These demands arise irrespective of gender. Isnt it fair to resolbe these demands irrespective of gender roles? Domestic activities arent regressive, they’re the most practical way to grow as an individual. The last thing we should do is shame someone for it.
We reside in a country where the home minister is a man and the finance minister is a woman and if that doesnt openly defy gender roles then i dont know what does.
A major milestone in a human’s life is when they step into the shoes of a parent. And every parents will second this when i say that one cant be a dutiful parent if they aren’t a friend of house chores and it’s a sign of stunted personality development of a child if they’re not inculcated with domestic expertise.
The man on our currency was someone who cleaned his own toilet. 
If we put on a religious lens we notice countless examples where our teachers taught us to embrace career and domestic activities equally.
Prophet Muhammad, always used to help Hazarat Ayisha( his beloved wife) in the daily chores. Washing utensils and cooking food, playing with her and keeping a race with her too. Hazarat Khadija, took control of her father's business when he passed away and ran all of it on her own, hiring other men in doing the business too. This explains:
1.Prophet encouraged helping in the household chores
2.Women should be educated too and be involved in running the business and other things as well.
From a bird’s eye view, a domestic ability is an asset. A feminist is a flagbearer of equality and the last thing they should do is shame someone for performing their basic essential life skills.","Giving Taliban that recognition would be solidifying it’s demand for the establishment of their goverment being recognised in the world. If UN does take the brave step here and openly defy the immoral government of taliban, it would throw a tight slap on their face with a curt answer that they wont get recognised as the deemed government of afghanistan as they should be since their ways to establish themselves as the official goverment of afghanistan were immoral. Their ruthless and brutal ways of living is something the world can never turn the page over. It’s plastered in the minds of the public of afghanistan and it’s never going to fade, it’s been imprinted forever.
From robbing them of their basic human rights to treating women like literal objects with no identity of their own, they need to be made to feel the same way by the rest of the world as they’ve made their public feel.
UN should not dignify them with the recognition because they need to feel that what they’re doing is henious and they’re not accepted by the rest of the world. Afghanistan being in grave debt is anyways not helping their foreign exchange, their economy has not skyrocketed since taliban has entered.

46,0,Yashika Gupta ,"If we look into the definition of empowering, it means to have control of your life and different people have different ways to feel confident. Since decades people have thought of domestic activities as demeaning and have taken it for granted. Feminists stood against this and portrayed domestic activities as a doom for a female's future. It was correct to some extent but they went wrong when they also started to sketch it as demeaning for female kind. 
Empowering doesn't always means to become self dependent but it also means to become self confident. Many housemakers don't want to earn money but want to take care of their family and invest their time in hobbies like gardening, cooking, interior decoration etc. They found their own system to feel self assured. 
The role of feminists are to challenge systemic inequalities women face in their daily life not to encourage it.

46,0,Nikunj Vashist,"Feminism is one of the basic movements for human liberty’ (Schneir, 1996: xi) a feminist role in society is to actively recognize the need for, and work towards creating equality for all women. Feminism is purely a movement which intends to enlighten people with a goal of improving gender equality and strengthening women’s status in society.Feminism on a whole has had a positive impact on society it has been a dramatically successful social movement. It has changed women’s expectations and perspectives on their lives. In the past, women would have to marry to gain financial security and stability. Women are now working and more independent than ever, by earning their own living, they do not need to rely on a man for stability.Finally, in response to wider social shifts, the aspirations of girls may have also increased. Thus girls now may have their sights set on university and a career – and this may translate into increased engagement with school. Recent reforms have opened opportunities to women – most notably the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which made gender discrimination in employment illegal.
women still suffer many injustices, discriminations and sometimes even outrages but there is no longer a coherent picture of male advantage and female disadvantage. Gender remains a crucial division in society but in a much more fractured and inconsistent way.The key message of feminism in the 21st century society should highlight choice in bringing a personal meaning to feminism is to recognise others’ right to do the exact same thing. Women all over the world nationally, regionally and globally should be able to embrace this powerful message of feminism and be able to create a positive meaning of their own womanhood and femininity. 

","Persian Shia Muslims ruled central Asia, including Afghanistan, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The Pashtun Ghilji tribe, whose members are Sunni Muslims, revolted against the Safavid’s brutal Governor Gurgin Khan, a Georgian monarch, and established their own empire under the Hotak dynasty in 1709.
The Hotaks ruled over portions of Afghanistan and Iran, before being stormed by the Persian emperor Nadir Shah, with Afghanistan falling under control of Shah’s Turkoman Afshar tribe. However, following Shah’s assassination in 1747, and capitalising on the disunity among the numerous Afghan tribes, Ahmad Shah Abdali, a commander of Shah and a member of the Pashtun Durrani tribe, firmly established the Durrani dynasty. As the Durrani dynasty weakened towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, the Afghan Emirate under the Barakzai tribe emerged in 1829.The suspicion and distrust forced the British to adopt a precautionary step to control Afghanistan by waging the first Anglo-Afghan war in 1838-42. Though the British annexed Kabul, it was a short-lived victory. The Afghans gave a bloody nose to British, who were eventually forced to withdraw from Afghanistan.
Even then, the British launched the second Anglo-Afghan war in 1878, which bore fruits to its long-standing plans. Afghanistan became a protectorate of Britain in 1880. With this political development and consolidation of the British in India, Russian Tzars lost further interest in Afghanistan.",False

According to me, Feminist women can do the domestic stuff. Feminism not only means respecting the rights of women but it means treating men and women equally. This means neither of them should be given any special rights, here in Delhi we can see that women are getting free rides on the bus, getting quotas in government colleges, etc.

I see a lot of women questing all the men about equal rights, and equal wages which I believe are given to them after the equal wage act like if a woman will do an equally good job she must be paid an equal wage. Some women often raise questions regarding their entry being banned in certain Hindu temples but at the same time, I would like to tell all of them that there are a lot of temples where the entry for men is banned too. Males were always equally oppressed in earlier times.

we should stop this pseudo-feminism and instead think of building a strong society. Both men and a female can do dusting, gardening, and domestic chores, and sometimes if the nonworking member of the family is doing most of the household chores may it be a man or woman doesn't matter which is depicted in the movie ""ki and ka"". The only thing we can do is to help them and make their work easy.

At last, I would just like to say that nothing is better than our mom's homecooked food and motherly love So we should definitely respect our sisters and mother.



 "," 1. Mexico's US border issue is indeed very serious, People from Mexico in return for better wages, way of living, or living standards try to leave their native land and travel to the US. Trump in his manifesto mentioned building a wall between us and Mexico to stop the immigrants and I believe this was a major contributing factor to his winning that election in the USA cause even the natives of America were concerned about this issue as there were reports from the western nations like France and Germany who gave place to the refugees that the crime rates in their country are increasing spontaneously. A lot of Mexicans are already living in the USA illegally. but only a few illegal activities are reported against them. 

Even congress of the USA believes that immigrants are helping the US economy grow, and that's why they even refused to fund the wall. The reason is pretty much simple the USA is a country full of lazy people who don't prefer labor work, therefore, activities such as agriculture, construction, etc are dominantly done by people other than Americans in the USA, and since most of those were immigrants they didn't need to give them that minimum wage set by the government of America and therefore it helped them to control inflation. US media extensively covered all the crimes reported by Mexicans such as thefts. A very recent report states that a lot of immigrants were out in cold during Christmas waiting for some relaxation in immigrant laws.

This problem can be solved by listening to what Trump once said that the funding for the wall should be taken from Mexico itself. Many strict laws are already implemented to stop any immigrant enter US.",False

Our men-dominated society considers women as an inferior breed and too considers their household chores a symbol of lower status, so women too influenced by all these things start seeing domestic activities as second-class work and jumped to various other fields of life like politics, astronomy, sports, country representative, even prime minister, and president !! and proudly maintained their top positions in all these top fields and proved their grandness to all those who consider women as menial beings.
But what I feel is that Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, and cooking) as empowering because domestic chores have their own importance and value.
And we all must contribute the needful.
A very common misconception is that only women can be feminists.
It is absolutely wrong but feminism does not just benefit women. It strives for equality of the sexes, not the superiority of women. Feminism takes the gender roles which have been around for many years and tries to deconstruct them.
So, the need of the hour is to change the mindset of non-feminists by letting domestic activities status to empower, to grow exponentially amid some narrow-minded foolish!!
The key message must be to highlight the choice in bringing personal meaning to feminism, to this revolutionary idea. It is to recognize other’s rights for doing the same thing. The sad part is that despite this idea, being a strong movement, there are still parts of the world where inequality and exploitation of women take place. Thus, we must all try to practice intersectional feminism and create awareness among people.

The recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban had a huge impact, especially on the people of Afghanistan. Taliban rule came into force after 2021. Though this takeover has been criticized by many countries still Taliban has aggressively campaigned demanding international recognition. Despite no countries recognizing the Islamic Emirate as the legitimate successor of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, there have been official diplomatic talks between the Taliban and other countries.
According to me, the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban as, since the takeover, the Taliban have portrayed their government as legitimate in hopes of attracting international recognition and occupying Afghanistan’s seat in the United Nations but it’s just hypocrisy.
A Possible recognition of the Taliban by the United Nations and other states would not only undermine some important principles of international law but would also have serious domestic and international implications. While the Taliban’s recognition would domestically undermine the right to self-determination of Afghans — which is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations — it would internationally embolden other terrorist organizations across the globe to topple governments and then demand international recognition as the legitimate government of the states they’d seized. 
More importantly, how can the U.N. or any individual state possibly recognize a government in which there are several cabinet members, including the minister of interior, that are listed, and sanctioned as terrorists by the U.N. and several states? Since their takeover of Kabul, the Taliban have not abandoned its terrorist undertakings, nor has it cut ties with other terrorist networks.

5,1,Shristi Kaur Anand,"Feminism simply states that all genders should have equal rights without having to put up with unfair treatment. For the longest time, we have been conditioned to believe that domestic activities, be it cooking, cleaning, gardening or laundry are something a woman would do. However, as women are becoming cognizant of the fact that there’s no job specific to a gender, they are giving up domestic activities, thinking it would make them inferior to men. Similarly, men are nurtured to grow up as someone who ensures that the family is financially stable and are anticipated to continue the hierarchy. This notion is changing and women are occupying positions of authority and doing just as good as men. 
Feminists all over the world are influencing women to not partake in domestic activities if similar contribution is not being received from the male counterparts. This has eventually led to some women not doing domestic work at all. While there's no denying of the fact that all the jobs, be it professional or domestic should be equally distributed among all the genders, just because someone else is failing to understand it, this doesn't imply that you shouldn't do your part. If you find solace in doing a domestic activity, say gardening, then you should go for it. If you believe you are responsible for doing a particular chore, then you shouldn't get overwhelmed by the fact that the other person is not doing it and end up not doing it at all. Thus, in my opinion, feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering and not something that will make them inferior.","Thousands and thousands of people illegally cross the US-Mexico border mostly to escape economic hardship, gang violence and poverty in their home countries to seek shelter in the US.

In multiple and very significant ways that have not been acknowledged or understood it will also affect communities all across the United States as well as Mexico While linguistic and financial barriers are majorly the reasons people migrate, some of them engage in illegal activities like drug smuggling. The surprising fact is that even though there are more than 200 tunnels used for smuggling drugs, most of the cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines are smuggled through the 52 legal ports of entry on the border.

Illegal immigrants costs the USA millions of dollars for border patrols and prisons.

5,1,Kartik Goel,"I would like to speak for the motion feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering.

First of all what empowerment means, it means a person has power and control on his own life. A woman can have control on her own life when she is economically and educationally empowered. Empowering women means empowering them with all the rights they should have in the society,family and country. It is to make them able so that they can take their decisions necessary for their personal development.Woman have more patience and this can play an important role in developing the country.It does not mean that women going out and working in a big MNC or in a factory are the only ones who can be considered empowered. Woman doing domestic activities can also be considered empowered. Like if a woman knows how to cook she can start tiffin(dibba) services for students and people working at offices. If she knows how to do gardening she can start gardening classes. If she knows how to sew clothes she can start working as a tailor in her home itself. If she is educated she can not only teach her own kids but can also start her tution classes. All these domestic activities can also make woman empowered. 

As it is seen in most families across the globe that the earning member of the family is given more respect, has influence in family decisions, empowerment of women becomes very important because it will not only earn them respect but will also enable them to leave abusive marriages and raise their kids on their own. 

At the end I would like to say that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities  as empowering because when a woman is indulged in domestic activities she can spend more time with her kids and can nurture then into a good human being which will in turn help to develop the society, nation and the world and make it a better place to live in. 
","After the recent change of government in Afghanistan and it's annexation by the Taliban, UN should not recognize Islamic Emirate of Taliban as a country.

Despite pledges of moderation and reforms they have swiftly reinstated many of their harsh policies like forcing a  women to go out only with a male member and their bodies completely covered.They have restrained girls from getting secondary education and have put restrictions on  journalism. People are so afraid of Taliban that when they entered Kabul, thousands tried to flee the country via airplane. Before annexation of Afghanistan by Taliban, people enjoy their rights and could choose their leaders but after annexation Taliban took the rights of citizens and forced people to follow their interpretation of Sharia laws.These clearly shows they are violating human and woman rights. It is important to protect rights of citizens and freedom of speech.With all of this I can say that UN should not recognize Islamic Emirate of Taliban as a country. ",False

All the talks are professional and how females should be getting equal pay and be on leadership positions. But in all these talks, they overlook gender equality at home. They see domestic activities as inferior jobs. They think that they are just following the gender stereotypes by engaging in domestic activities. They should be open to sharing household responsibilities such as cooking, gardening, etc. Gender equality at home is essential to realize the same at work.

This shows the situation in Mexico and that quality of life has decreased rapidly. This is due to increasing crimes in Mexico. There are many drug lords, rapes and theives in Mexico. Gang wars are becoming common and local police are incompetent to stop these crimes. People who want to leave gangs are trying to migrate illegally or are killed in the process. US has also seen a surge in crimes. The main reason for that is unemployment of immigrated people. They are unable to find work and are being forced to do crimes to make a living. The possible solution for increasing crimes are providing the immigrants with decent jobs and making the immigration process more Transparent and easy. More workforce should be appointment at asylums and border. ",False
5,1,Divyanshu Kumar,"I firmly believe that the very basic element of equality and freedom is to have the right to do what you want and also to refuse to do what you don't want irrespective of your gender, cast, colour, religion, creed etc while also being equal to everyone. Believing that ""Feminist should do/don't do"" any type of particular work to be ""empowering"" is contradicting the basic idea of feminism and freedom itself which is to do what you want which also includes domestic activities such as gardening, cooking etc, it is only wrong when they are forced to do these because of their gender. Feminism was started as a revolt against the worsening conditions of women in these highly male dominated societies of the world and to demand the equal rights for them and to not judge their capabilities on the basis of their gender but as the time gone by people started believing that being a feminist means being a man hater, refuse to do domestic works and indulging ourselves into toxic habits which is completely against the fundamental reasons of the beginning of feminism which is needed to be changed.

""what can do to bring a change in their lives?"". US can easily shirk off this situation by simply saying ""this ain't our problem"" but they have to remember that they were the one who supplied illegal weapon and money to those criminal drug trafficking gangs of South and Central America who turned the lives of people a living hell for their own advantage.

The most basic solution to this problem is to stop the US government from funding these illegal gangs for their own advantage and to provide the refugees with basic elements fot their survival and to stop believing thst building a wall on border will solve the problem, the corrupt politicians of Central America are also needed to be changed and democracy should be restored so that the countries should run on a properly elected government and not on criminal gangs.",False
5,1,Samarth Agnihotri,"Yes, Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening, cooking etc as empowering. But, the Eutopian feminist idea was initially about giving women fundamental rights and opportunities at all levels of a human survival spectrum ranging from politics, bussiness, medical, law etc etc. The idea was to enable them to pursue whatever they are intrigued by or aspire to move forward with, in life. Today a modern feminist approach is about placing women equal to/right beside men at all levels of social, political, ecominimal, hierarchy order. This deviation from an opportunity based approach to an outcome based approach came as a resistance towards discrimination against women being a big place holder in the course of human history. To create an opinion on the phenomena of discrimination against women we must try understanding the initial division of gender roles in a early human society. Anthropological experts provide a great explanation for this. 
Initially when humans were hunters and gatherers, men of the family used to go out to gather food, do hunting, gather resources because of their physical strengths whereas women were giving responsibilities of the household and offsprings because of their nurturing and emotional side. As we can see this is our biology which made men more physically stronger which was better for the survival extinct whereas nurturing emotions, feelings for taking care and growth of the offsprings and household. 
This evolution of gender roles happened due to circumstancial change in social, political, economical strucutures of human society throughout the course of history. So when in 1940s, during the World War when men were out fighting wars,
It was women of the affected countries who stepped up to take care of the business and other circumstances back in the country. That was the very first time in recorded human history when women became high business stake holders of various countries and led to the idea of women being part of hierarchical structure of human sustainance.
This clearly proves that gender roles are decided circumstancially to ensure human growth and survival and as we can all see, women being part of all institutes of nations like India. Hence, to grow, it is important to give women of all demographies opportunities to pursue their interests in life.
Having said that, empowerment as a concept shouldn't be perceived differently. Empowerment is about equipping someone with skills, knowledge and ideas in order to become better at their sustainance and contribution towards human culture and society. 
So yes, not just feminists but all humans should consider domestic activities like gardening, cooking etc as empowering.","The recognition of Taliban means the admission of all that they stand for. The Taliban is a symbol of oppression against all the minority sections of  society, and women.

With the recognition of Taliban you make sure there is no hope for improvement and you reconcile with the failure of society in general.

5,1,Srishti Yadav ,"The narrative should be altered wherein we consider that doing certain activities by a particular section is to be deemed empowering. This nullifies the value that any activity carries with itself.

We should inhibit the association of household chores as a one-man job assigned by gender. The basic social structure requires a change wherein it is expected of women to do these jobs instead of it being a choice.

Moreover, we must understand the true meaning of the word empowerment-It is a word that brings up the question of personal agency. It links an individual to the society around them associating them with the concepts of human rights and social justice. When this is applied to gender issues, it naturally puts women at the forefront. Thus empowerment simply means a redistribution of power between the two sexes across several institutions.

Empowering women shouldn’t be a burden.
Predominant notions of empowerment characterize it as an increase in a person’s ability to do what they choose. It certainly shouldn’t be reduced to associating it with mere tasks that all should learn for basic survival. Prevalent conditions of inequality and poverty structure the choices of women in such a way that choosing among the alternatives present is no less than a forced decision of sorts.

What the motion is doing is forcing the concept of empowerment. Empowerment shouldn’t be forced. Certain kinds of activities shouldn’t denote what is representing the empowerment of one.","The 2000 miles long terrain separating the two nations of the United States and Mexico has been under notoriety for being the most traversed border in the world-largely unauthorized. 

The heavy influx of immigrants poses challenges on operational, humanitarian, and policymaking fronts. In those regions, unemployment, poverty, and violence are often the primary reasons for migration. Violence, poverty, and COVID-19 are some of the reasons that have forced people to flee to the border to seek asylum. Immigrants face more than just the grueling journey through tight security layers to escape. Heat, dehydration, and encounters with violent gangs are only some of the issues that they have to face while attempting to cross the border.

 The COVID-19 pandemic and the continued denial of asylum only aggravate the situation. There is an uncertain future awaiting the migrants at the border. Some cities where asylum seekers are sent are known to witness heinous crimes like kidnapping, sexual assault, etc. This represents only the tip of the iceberg.
The number of people looking for accommodation in migrant shelters provided by the government and NGOs is already quite high. As a result, many wind up on the streets without shelter. These restrictive policies have led to asylum seekers waiting in Mexico for an unprecedented amount of time with no certainty of their future. 

All of these are major contributors to the escalating crime rates in this region. Crimes such as drug trafficking, smuggling, murder, and extortion represent a threat to communities on both sides of the border. Mexican border towns have been experiencing an increase in murders due to drug trafficking and smuggling. As these services are illegal, migrants are quite vulnerable to abuse. Many are abandoned on their way and some end up dying. Drug cartels and gang-related violence have also been on the rise. The greed for greater profits has resulted in increased violence. Moreover, illegal trading across the border has increased the trafficking of firearms. It is a problem that undermines the quality of life of people on either side. 

Policies and legislation that is inadequate need to be fixed if we are to reach a solution. The cooperation of the governments and law enforcement of both nations is required to come to a viable solution. Tracking down drug trafficking cartels involves analyzing their movement routes and confiscating their assets, whether they are drugs, firearms, or people. Specifically, it requires an increase in international cooperation, improved coordination, and the identification of loopholes and fallacies.",False

When we first hear the name wife the first image that comes to our mind regarding their work is the work of a housewife . Though such a thing is getting fainter with time but still it exists .Married women do more housework than their men and especially in a country like India it's even worse. In today's society men definitely need to do their fair share in housework . Women still hold most of the burden of housework and along with that they also have to bear their children. Housework can sometimes be the most stressful job for a women and it's one of the least respected work
I mean it's clearly visible to our eyes but we never 
appreciate it, we don't even think of appreciating it . I guess we never acknowledge it because it's so regular to our eyes and never seems unique to us. Even women are getting educated in today's era, they have got their own goals , they have their own desires and with the knowledge they have got making them sit at home would make their knowledge go to waste. Kids are dependent on their mothers so much that they can't even have a glass of water on their own though it's the mother's affection that listens to all such demands but it's really tiring you know . If we the so called feminist reclaim domestic activites it will not only be empowering to women but will be aid to mankind . The men will develop housework skills which will be essential at some point and will even get to know the pain a female might be going through.

No, the UN shouldn't recognise the islamic emirate of the Taliban . As a terrorist organization like taliban would only violate the human rights of afganistan and spread terrorism. After the Taliban captured the country and took control over it .Ashraf ghani(the former president) chose to flee the country. This shows how intimidating Taliban was even for the president then you can imagine how frightening it is for the people .
Despite the bad reputation Taliban has made they should atleast provide human rights to people ( like girl education and freedom is one of them ) for them to get recognised.

5,1,Kanishka Raisania,"“Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering”, I totally agree on this statement.
Women empowerment is not just illustrated by highly educated, ambitious and  career driven women. An empowered woman is also someone who chooses to be a housewife and not have a job. It’s about having the freedom to make your own choices and lead the life of your own choosing.
People use working and employed women as an example of independent and empowered women. But when we start talking about a housewife, many people undervalue a housewife, even by women also. Some feminists portray household works as if they have no value. As if housewives have no value.
 Household works are not less than any corporate job. A housewife’s value is no more or less than a working wife or husband. Handling the house whole day without any break is not an easy task. It's as valuable as a job. On an average, women spend 299 minutes a day on unpaid domestic services for household members. It’s the stereotype people have created that housewives do not work or do not add economic value to the household. This kind of mindset that has persisted for many years is very problematic and must be overcome.
It’s about having the freedom to make your own choices and lead the life of your own choosing
Household works should be everyone’s responsibility either it’s a woman or a man.
Being a housewife is not necessarily indicative of being lazy or laid back, dominated and oppressed. Housewives are also an example of empowered women. We should appreciate the role of a housewife and her contributions toward family.
In conclusion, household works should be given recognition and value as much as the role of a working man/woman. “Equality and empowerment isn’t only about career and education, it’s about your state of mind and the way you live your life.”

","In my opinion, UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. . Otherwise it would give message or provoke other group across the globe to do such things for recognition. Such an act would only portray the supporting the terrorist community. Recognition of Taliban would mean the recognition of terrorism and acceptance of human rights violations. Promoting such a religious extremist group would undermine human rights in the country. 
Taliban has taken over Afghanistan by forced control and extrajudicial killings, mass eviction of minorities and torturing local people. Since the day Taliban has taken control on majority of Afghanistan, they are imposing merciless rules on the residents. Also, Taliban didn’t hold any elections and not even allowed Afghans to voice their opinions about their government. In the beginning, Afghans supported Taliban because they could finally saw the stability Taliban has brought in the country after so many wars. The fight that has been going on for so many years was coming to an end. In reality also, Taliban brought peace and tranquility to some areas of Afghanistan. But as the passage of time, Taliban started showing its true colors i.e. their conservative and extremist thinking. Since August 2021, Taliban banned girl’s education and women’s rights to equality and justice. Taliban forced acts of violence against women, including rape, abduction and forced marriage. They also imposed men to have a beard and women to wear a burkha. Taliban explicitly prohibited women’s movement outside the home without a man accompanying them. Taliban removed the ministry of women and replaced it with the Ministry of Amr Bil Maruf which conducts religious and moral policing. They continued killing former government employees and hazaras mercilessly. Taliban is spreading terrorism and filling young minds with poison of religious extremism and hate. 
All the cruelty Taliban is doing, making the innocent people suffer; such a terrorist community should never be recognized in the UN. No human has the right to torture other human. Taliban’s rule can never bring peace to Afghanistan. In conclusion to everything I have stated so far, I am against the recognition of Taliban in the UN.

3,0,Srishti Srivastava,"I would like to speak against the motion. 
Feminism by definition is the belief that men and women deserve equal opportunities and rights.
Feminism is about general equality, not who will do the housework and who won't. It is about the division of labour instead, so that if both the man and the woman come home exhausted from work, she doesn't have to get up and work alone again. 

The gender imbalance is still thriving in society, we are yet to see a good amount of men ready to pick up a mop and get to work without being told a billion times over and without thinking of it as a favour instead of a responsibility. And that is because most men when they were boys weren't taught this as an essential part of their life. 

It is not necessary that the domestically inclined person in the household be a female. In fact if activities such as cooking and gardening must be reclaimed for moral good, it should be done by both men and women in a balanced manner. 

Cooking, cleaning, gardening, laundry, etc should be done by everyone who is affected by their results. A clean house is for all its residents and so it is only reasonable for all of them to take part it in keeping it like that. 

Orthodox gender roles need to be defeated as quickly as possible and all kinds of work should be seen as just work, without and preliminary gender requirements. ","No, the UN should absolutely not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. However small, such a recognition is bound to fuel them further. 

The Taliban have rose to power again in 2021, obliterating women's rights, destroying girls' futures and those of the country alike. Many of their actions have been severe human rights violations which are absolutely not acceptable.

They have imposed a harsh and twisted interpretation of the Islamic Law which is only going to cause destruction and more tragedy. Moreover, their efforts to transition into a functional government have also proven fruitless since their are struggling to provide basic services and safety.

All sorts of mass media has been taken by the throat and shoved down what with journalists and news portals being forcibly closed. All of this is detrimental for a country as a whole and not just for today but for generations to come. 

If the UN recognises them, they will acquire global validation for what they are doing and I don't think that that would be great for this miserable situation. ",False
5,1,Shreyashi Das,"I am against the motion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering. Even if household activities such as gardening and cooking are stereotypically associated with women since past generations, embracing it as a part of the female identity will not help women collectively in proving their capabilities in fields like science, business, law, technology and politics. Since feminists believe in equal rights for both genders of our society, in order to fight for their rights in the society they must hold positions of power in fields which impact the advancement and functioning of the society directly. This will help women to get equal status along with men and remove the gender disparities. I believe their should be an equal responsibility between both the genders to perform household activities. The idea is to not conform to the roles set by patriarchal society ages ago. By this approach, the general image of women performing household chores will slowly be overturned which will encourage them to step outside the boundaries set by the society and take up positions of responsibilities in the real world. This way feminists can hope to put an end to sexism and sexist exploitation to achieve full gender equality in law and in practice.","No, I am against UN recognizing Afghanistan as Islamic Emirate of Taliban because it violates the values UN stands for. According to a report, Taliban maintains a close relationship with the terrorist group ‘Al-Qaeda’ which gives them more liberty for international attacks. The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations. The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down. Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared. The Taliban also enforced prohibitions on behavior deemed un-Islamic. Women rights were denied. It has also been seen that the economic situation has worsened in Afghanistan since the Taliban started governing. The right way to approach such situation would be for powerful countries to cutoff diplomatic ties with the government which has been happening according to the news. The UN should also put its terms and conditions forward if Taliban needs financial assistance and representation in UN assembly since Taliban is not functioning like a proper government according to the reports. Also it is obviously not encouraged to promote a single religion in country. Hence, if Afghanistan is recognized by another name, it is better to not use Islam in the new name. By promoting Islam in ways like recognising it in the name, the country will become unsafe for other religious minorities which might later disrupt the peace and harmony due to discontentment within the minorities.",False

Yes, We need to redistribute equality in unpaid domestic work as well but I agree that feminists should reclaim that domestic activities such as cooking and gardening should be consider as empowering. ""No work is small or big"", we should appreciate each others work. The domestic activities should be recognized as a work. If we want to build a healthy society, we have to eventually come out of the mindset that ""what get paid is the only work and rest is just nothing"". Domestic work do not get paid but it is of great importance. Feminism should not be about letting women go and do a paid work instead It should be about giving equal importance to both work. And at the end ""it's her choice"". In many parts of the world, still women are have to forcibly do the domestic work or they simply they do not know their rights and do not get excess to knowledge and education, so they simply thinks that what their life should be. I  know this should not happen but there are also cases where women do the domestic work and care because they simply like to do so. So, the conclusion should be that Domestic work should be consider as empowering but at the same time we need to build a society where there is a full participation and partnership of both women and men in every sphere including care and nurturing of children and maintenance of the household.","NO, I think UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

The Asia Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, conducted a survey that says that only 13.4 percent of Afghans had sympathy for the Taliban.  An overwhelming majority surveyed said it was important to protect women’s rights, freedom of speech, and the constitution. We should think of the humankind instead of rules and restrictions.

5,1,Aatmashri Sanyal,"Feminists don't need to reclaim domestic activities because we have not left them in the first place. Agreeing with the motion would mean that feminism excludes women who involve themselves in household chores. Are you trying to tell me housewives aren't feminists? Women, who enjoy cooking, and gardening are not feminists? I realise going back to the kitchen is still a means to mock the progress feminists have made in the world outside the kitchen, but the feminism I understand is not this exclusionary and it will never be. 

Today I, Aatmashri Sanyal, will be speaking against the motion ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering"".

Empowerment they say is the process that enables one to construct their political agendas and transform power structure. Thus, it is empowering to be a corporate team leader as much as it is to be a woman taking care of her domestic life. As the motion insists, since, feminism is about empowerment, it includes both the kind and more.  

Additionally, feminism was about bringing women together and about things as basic as choices. To exclude a kind, because their idea of liberation is different from mine, would go against the ethical foundation of this movement. Further, it would also divide us from my kind - something that patriarchy has always thrived on. We should not tolerate this system pitting us against each other any longer. It is high time we realise that girls need to support girls. So, whether you are the sansari kind or the rebel, I am here with you, by you and I hope you do the same for me. Let's bring the patriarchy down together.

","Given the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, should the UN recognise the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban? 

My answer is no. There is no if, but or why to this. Just no. Taliban has annexed a nation outside its own will and by the means of force. The Taliban is historically renowned for being anti human rights and therefore unworthy of diplomatic recognition. Even though they have repeatedly assured the opposite, there is plethora of evidence backing that the Taliban has committed gross human rights violations against the people of Afghanistan, in particular women and girls, imposing degrading anti-women rules. The UN has always advocated for the voice of the people and nowhere in this annexation do you hear that voice.  Also, ever since the Taliban took over, it has internally faced innumerable protests; protests that this government has cracked down on brutally. The news that makes its way out of that country since the takeover has been tragic and to give legitimacy to this government would be to commit moral blasphemy. 

From last week's news, we learn that the Taliban has banned some from higher education. This is among the many atrocities that this government is wreaking on its people. It would be degrading to call the Taliban a government. It is a dictatorial takeover by a power that is autocratic, orthodox and brutal. My heart goes out to the people of Afghanistan and what lies ahead for them, especially for the women.

5,1,Ohm Tyagi,"As per my opinion I beg to go against the given statement because I think any kind of work which can't give you money and power can never be considered as empowering. As far as domestic activities such as cooking, cleaning, gardening, taking care of children and elderly etc are considered they can be called empowering if and only if you are doing them professionally and you are getting paid for it. Women carry out at least two and a half times more unpaid household and care work then men. As a result they have less time to engage in paid labour or work longer hours combining paid and unpaid labour. Women's unpaid work subsidizes the cost of care that sustains families supports economies but the bitter truth is that doing all this never made them empowered and self dependent. Also I feel that being over occupied by all the domestic activities is the main reason that prevents them from getting good education, participating in public and political activities and influencing the society for giving equal freedom and opportunities for both males and females. It's a fact that women account for only ten percent of senior investment professionals. Also female founders receive only two percent of venture capital funding. In my opinion feminism is about changing these statistics. We want and need to change these numbers, to provide equal opportunities for women and allow the industry to realize the benefits of diversity. We endeavor to level the playing field in investing. Feminism is having confidence. It is finding your voice when you feel alone at the table. We want every woman to feel empowered to speak her mind. We want every woman to be inspired to raise her hand and succeed, and have the confidence to risk failure in the pursuit of excellence.

5,1,Prisha Priya ,"For the motion:

This isn’t about “girls are better than boys, boys are better than girls”. It’s about why even make a difference?

Little boys many a times are told to play with cars instead of dolls as they are assumed to be ""girly"" and ""inappropriate for boys"", whereas girls playing with cars or engaging in tough sports are labelled as ""tomboys"".

This is a small example of how everything associated with the female genes is labelled as “girly” or “ fragile” by the society. Similar is the case for household chores.

Women, even if in a paid job, are often expected to bear the responsibilities of household chores on themselves. A man doing the same job isn’t expected to take over these duties because of the demeaning sense the house work is looked upon as. It is thought of as the ""women's job"" and often made to look as unimportant, whereas it is equally important as earning money. A woman handling all the household duty alone is unfair on her as it seriously restricts her from being focussed on her career. There is a dire need to empower these duties so that whatever shame exists for taking up these responsibilities ceases.

If a woman is being a pillar in the income of the family, a man could very rightfully be a partner in the household chores. And this doesn’t mean a passive help where you wait for the other person’s guidance. It requires active participation in the matter where both partners have equal credibility to look after the house. 

Feminism isn’t about making women stronger. Women are already strong. It’s about changing the way the world perceives that strength. And it requires acceptance towards the idea that men and women could run a household together, earning to cleaning, it’s not a one gender job. Life isn’t a competition between men and women. It is a collaboration. And this collaboration would work when we perceive this issue as a people vs prejudice one.","While the UN recognises every state of power of a country, the annexation by the Taliban in Afghanistan is a puzzling situation. Taliban, since coming to power in 2021, has taken measures where the motive was to make its authority more powerful with each coming day. Its decisions have taken over the world news regularly, as more and more human rights are being suppressed in the nation.

Since its annexation several people fled the country, many died and millions still live in fear. Girls are not being allowed to pursue education to their maximum calibre, work or drive. Human rights violation is at its peak.

This is directly or indirectly affecting the entire world. Hence, human rights violation by a government on its own people is making the people of the world, especially the people of Afghanistan pay a huge price.

The government has restricted media freedom and is on its way to repression and persecution to control what news reaches the world. This shows how the Taliban is scared of being cut off by the world in case of severe backlash that it could face if evidences to the cruelties is released anyhow. 

Therefore, I believe the UN shouldn’t recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as it would only become a sign of their empowerment. No country could ever survive all by itself. It needs other countries either for importing one resource or the other, or exporting its resources for capital. At this point, global dissent is an important factor into pushing the state of power in Afghanistan to stop the extreme human suffering occurring in the country. If the UN recognises the Islamic Emirate of Taliban it would only give it more power to continue exploiting the rights of people.

5,1,Ahaan Singh," FOR THE MOTION
Feminism is a movement that advocates for the social, political, and economic equality of all genders. One aspect of feminism is challenging traditional gender roles and norms, which often assign certain activities and responsibilities to specific genders. Domestic activities such as gardening and cooking have often been considered ""women's work"" and have been devalued as a result. Reclaiming these activities as empowering is an important way for feminists to challenge and deconstruct these traditional gender roles and to assert that all types of work are worthy of respect and value. By actively engaging in domestic activities and promoting them as empowering, feminists can help to shift cultural attitudes and values towards a more inclusive and equitable understanding of gender roles. Additionally, domestic activities such as gardening and cooking can be personally fulfilling and can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. By reclaiming these activities as empowering, feminists can reclaim agency and control over their own lives and assert their right to engage in activities that bring them joy and fulfilment.
Overall, actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering is an important aspect of feminist activism and can help to promote gender equality and challenge traditional gender roles and norms.
","The perilous situation of immigrants locked between the US-Mexico border is a complex and multifaceted issue that has significant implications for both the United States and Mexico.

One major issue is the rise of illegal activities, such as human trafficking and smuggling, which often exploit and endanger the lives of immigrants. These illegal activities often involve organized criminal networks that profit from the vulnerable and desperate circumstances of many immigrants.The impact of these illegal activities on both the United States and Mexico is significant. In the United States, the influx of undocumented immigrants can strain resources and create challenges for law enforcement and other government agencies. In Mexico, the demand for illegal immigration services can fuel corruption and contribute to other social and economic problems. To address this problem, it is important to take a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and seeks to address the underlying social, economic, and political factors that drive people to leave their home countries. This could include efforts to improve living conditions and economic opportunities in countries of origin, as well as addressing the demand for illegal immigration services in destination countries.Other potential solutions could include strengthening border security and law enforcement efforts, while also providing humanitarian assistance and support to immigrants who are in need. It is also important to ensure that immigrants are treated with dignity and respect and that their rights are protected.

Ultimately, finding effective solutions to the perilous situation of immigrants locked between the US-Mexico border will require the cooperation and efforts of both the United States and Mexico, as well as other international actors.",False

Many times, we heard about many protests', speeches by great peoples and many more but actually few knows the actual meaning of empowerment. empowerment actually means the process of gaining freedom and power to do what you want or to control what happens to you.so being in against the motion I want to say, ""Feminists should not actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" women always have to do household and domestic activities is a wrong mindset in this current time as women have also a right to live their life according to them and  according to the current era  women wants to be more powerful than men due to the violence they face in their societies, they face many difficulties due to lack of money one of them is total dependency on men which makes men overbearing . to measure the caliber and skills of women till household works is definitely wrong according to my sense as men do their earnings and other skillful works according to their skills and their hobbies in similar way women have also right to do work according to their own hobbies and willing. To being empowered with only and only domestic activities is definitely burring their skills and caliber in a dig which also suppress their voice in front of man dominating society. and everyone knows domestic works are necessary to live a better and good life as they are also important like cooking which fulfills a basic requirement of food for both men and women. so, to feeding all family members and helping them in others daily work like cleaning, cooking and all .why they have to bury their own wills wehers we have a solution for this that both men and women should equally participate in domestic activities, and they should give their remaining time to their skills and earning which will make society better. so at the last i want to conclude that whatever women wants to do to empower them they should do that work instead of calling domestic works as their duty.","The Taliban has ruled Afghanistan as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan since taking control by force in just past few years, overthrowing the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The takeover was widely criticized by the international community, and no countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the new regime, despite nominally maintaining relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban has aggressively campaigned for international recognition since the takeover. Several countries have vowed never to recognize the Islamic Emirate, and others have said they will do so only if human rights are respected. Some countries have accredited Taliban diplomats at the charge affairs level despite not recognizing the Islamic Emirate. The Taliban previously ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and received limited diplomatic recognition, with the United Nations and most countries continuing to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan, which the Taliban had reduced to a rump state. Ousted president Ashraf Ghani has largely remained silent since the takeover and has not formed a government in exile. Ghani's vice president Amrullah Saleh declared himself caretaker president and relocated to Panjshir Province after the Taliban takeover with the support of the National Resistance Front. However, he fled Afghanistan after the Taliban quickly captured the province. Although the NRF continues to wage a guerrilla insurgency, it has failed to take any territory and neither Saleh nor the NRF have received any international support, leaving the Taliban as the only viable claimant to Afghanistan's government.",False

5,1,amaan ali,"I think feminists should embrace domestic activities as empowering because of the several seasons. 

Traditionally household activities like caring for children, cooking and cleaning have been considered as a female domain, as a result, these activities have often been considered undervalued. By embracing it feminists can work to change the way how these activities are perceived. Like how Tyrian Lannister says “Never forget what you are, the world will not. Wear it like armour and it can never be used to hurt you”.

And even for many, caring for their house and children and doing the “women’s-work” is a source of fulfilment and satisfaction. So if feminists will not embrace it and consider these works below them then they in a way will be harming fellow females instead of helping them. 

Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also challenge the notion that women’s work is only valuable if it is paid, feminists can resist the idea that domestic work is unworthy of respect. and demonstrate that a housewife deserves equal if not more recognition and respect compared to the female earning for her family.

Furthermore, embracing domestic activities as empowering can also help to challenge traditional gender roles and expectations. For too long, women have been expected to take on the majority of household work while men have been expected to focus on their careers and public lives. By valuing and honouring domestic work, feminists can work towards creating a more equal division of labour within households and ultimately create a more equal society. 

In conclusion, feminists should embrace domestic activities as empowering as a way to challenge societal expectations, find personal fulfilment, make an equal society and resist oppressive systems. ","The question of whether the UN should legitimize the Taliban rule is a very complex and fragile issue which will have a significant effect on the political landscape in Afghanistan and the region and most importantly the Afghan people. 

One might say it’s been a year since the Taliban takeover and to stop the bloodshed that had been going on for the last 2 decades and to attain stability we need to fill the power vacuum that had been created by the dismissal of the USA and Afghanistan government and recognising the Taliban is the positive step towards it. And it’s not like they don’t have influence in Afghanistan the Taliban has previously held power in Afghanistan, and some believe that the group could play a constructive role in shaping the country's future.

But what concerns people is the Taliban regime’s behaviour towards women and minorities. After the takeover, they imposed various restrictions on women. Their vile interpretation of the Quran and the influence of religion in politics could cause a barrier to their growth as a country.  Recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate government could legitimize these practices and signal that the UN condones such behaviour.

Ultimately, the decision to recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government must be made by members of the UN, taking into account the views and interests of all parties involved without any influence of other external powers. It is essential that any decision is based on careful consideration of the potential consequences and is made in the best interests of the Afghan people.",Maybe

There are people who nowadays show anger when women are asked to contribute to the household if not by working outside then by being a home maker or just on occasion to partake in these activities. And they call themselves feminists. Being feminist really means that every job is equal whether it is cooking or flying an aircraft. If a woman can build a company and take pride in that then she can definitely take pride in making a home for her family members.

46,0,Sushobhit raj,"There are people who believe that we do not need feminism today, but nothing could be further from the truth. Women have struggled for equality and against oppression for centuries, and although some battles have been partly won - such as the right to vote and equal access to education – women are still disproportionally affected by all forms of violence and by discrimination in every aspect of life.


It is true that in some areas and on certain issues, there have been improvements: for example, in Saudi Arabia women were allowed, for the first time, to vote and run for office in 2015(!). However, on other issues there has been little or no progress: for example, there have been insignificant reductions in cases of violence against women. Women continue to receive lower pay for the same work as men in all parts of the world; there are still countries that do not have laws against marital rape and still allow child brides, and practices such as 'honour' killings and female genital mutilation still exist.

Jokes about feminism and stereotypes about feminists persist, and many of these are also homophobic and assume that being lesbian is something ‘bad’. In fact, being a feminist is not something particular to any sex or gender: there are women and men who consider themselves feminists, some are gay or lesbian, some heterosexual, bisexual or transgender - and some may identify differently.

The concept of feminism reflects a history of different struggles, and the term has been interpreted in fuller and more complex ways as understanding has developed. In general, feminism can be seen as a movement to put an end to sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression and to achieve full gender equality in law and in practice.","The U.S. Border Patrol reported nearly 200,000 encounters with migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border in July, the highest monthly total in more than two decades.

5,1,Tejanshi,"We've come full circle from the beginnings of feminism in the 1970s, when women were rejecting the traditional homemaker role and moving out of the house. Now it's a space they are reclaiming, as we can see from the proliferation of television programmes and books about home crafts and decorating.
But the reclamation of domestic activities is harming the feminist movement.  Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank shows that eight out of 10 married women do more household chores, while just one in 10 married men does an equal amount of cleaning and washing as his wife. All this alongside balancing their professional lives. Though still persistent, the pay gap has fairly reduced but the 'chore gap' remains as present as ever. 
For women to be professionally successful, outsourcing domestic activities has become an unspoken requirement. In such a situation associating women with such responsibilities and calling it empowerment seems to be mockery. When it comes to family planning the general trend is for the women of the family to leave the workforce. Whether by choice or by family unfriendly policies. 
Performing domestic activities simply cannot be equated to empowerment, when the cost of these is career sacrifice. Cooking, gardening cleaning are basic life tasks and everyone should learn them. But portraying women as the sole members of the society who perform these leads to society seeing these as feminine and discouraging men to be an active participant in housekeeping.","The UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

Afghanistan has the world's second worst rate of maternal death during childbirth. About 16 out of every 100 women die giving birth. 
The Taliban also restricted the freedom of expression, right to form associations, right to work, right to healthcare etc. Women across the country were kicked out of the active workforce and forced to not leave the house.

Empowerment, as known and said by everyone, is the state of having power and control over one's life, while also being as equal as everyone else in the society. 

Domestic activities like gardening, cooking, and cleaning do not count as empowering because it's what our society expects women to do, irrespective of their own choices or opinions. These kinds of activities limit women to their households and deprive them of their equal role and participation in the society. They do not have a say outside of their households, neither do they get to earn anything for themselves, compromising their financial freedom. It also makes them look like liabilities who can’t earn for themselves. These activities make them care and look after their families and not themselves, hence losing their sense of self-worth. They barely get any time or resources for themselves. 

Also, these activities portray women as soft and caring ones in the society, making them look inferior to men or other sections of society, increasing the attempts to dominate them or reject their opinions and choices. 

Hence any household activities should never be reclaimed by feminists, who advocate for gender equality, as empowering.

Taliban took over Afghanistan through civil war, weapons and violence.

Now recognizing this government would only mean that everything is alright and letting them go off their heinous crimes. It would mean forgetting all they've done, and it would mean that the UN would do nothing if it were to happen again in some other country in the near future.

Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking, cleaning) as empowering. Nowadays, many people view performing domestic activities as being oppressed but that is not the case, in fact being capable to do such activities provides a sense of independence, and being independent helps in building confidence. Although I still believe that this should be a person’s choice if he/she wants to learn cooking, etc. or not and in a relationship someone shouldn’t be forced to do domestic activities because of gender stereotypes but people who do it shouldn’t think of it as being oppressed, it is being independent and it’s empowering. Afterall, feminism is about equality so it doesn’t matter who decides to do domestic work as long as he/she likes doing it. People who take the responsibility of doing domestic work aren’t actually paid although they contribute a lot of their time to it. In today’s society domestic work is not dignified and they are considered to be servants because of which many people refrain from taking this job. But I personally think that one should know these skills, and it should be empowered because it will prevent dependency on someone. Cooking, doing dishes, laundry, etc. are some essential skills that the youth of our country lacks in as they’ve been dependent on their family members for too long and they didn’t bother learning them because of gender stereotypes or because they viewed it as being oppressed. So I think people should encourage domestic work more and feminists should reclaim it as empowering to promote independence.
","I believe that given the current situation of Afghanistan, where there is no other alternative government in sight, the UN should conduct an impartial referendum in the state of Afghanistan. This will uncover the will of the people to be or not to be ruled by the Taliban.
Post collecting the results of this referendum, the UN has 2 options to aid the state:
1) If the vote favors the government established by the Taliban group, then the UN should peacefully recognize the reinstated govt. Of Afghanistan. 
2) If the vote is against the Taliban Govt. then the UN should take action against the annexation of the state by using methods under chapters 6 & 7 of the UN charter.
The establishment of a govt in Afghanistan is either way, an important aspect that the UN needs to work on since it is a central part of its regional politics and would contribute to regional security. Moreover, for Afghanistan to remain a state, in accordance with the Montevideo convention- it needs to fulfill the 4 pillars of the criteria of statehood, ie, (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter relations with the other states.

Feminists on the other hand is a person who believes in equal rights for all genders.

Now about the question  I believe that yes UN should give recognition to islamic emirate of Taliban. Let's start from what is exactly Taliban and how it came into power??
The Taliban are a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. After US left Afghanistan who toppled the original regime in 2001, Taliban in August of 2021 came back into power.  Under their harsh rule, they have cracked down on women’s rights and neglected basic services. The Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities. Now the biggest question arises should Taliban be even considered a government?. Should UN recognise the Islamic emirate of Taliban?
The answer is not that simple.  In simple words Traditionally, international recognition requires meeting four conditions by a new government: (1) effective control;(2) popular support and domestic legitimacy; (3) permanency and stability; and (4) ability and willingness to fulfill international obligations. Taliban fails to fulfill most of the the requirements but I would say that Taliban is finally a finally country with a ruling alliance.... ....if UN really cares about small countries they will not abide by the old norms made by some developed nations. We have to understand this thing that afghanistan could have never been a democracy.. it's history and social conditions never wanted  this to happen. Yes we can't justify how Taliban came into power but now In order to move forward together as one world we have to give some form of recognition to Taliban. Afghanistan economy is already dead, majority of population is under below poverty line and it is facing a hell lot of problem.. we have already sanctioned allot of things for afganistan now it's the time to grow together as a world.

5,1,Aakanksha priya,"When we talk about feminism, the very basic thing that comes in mind Is equality and equal rights. This term equality is valid and prevalent in all the aspects whether it's about equal pay or doing simple household chores like gardening, cooking, cleaning etc. Being empowered mean that one has the ability to survive and grow as an individual on their own, so obviously these activities can be considered empowering too. We all know that most students move out when they enter their university years and that's when we realize how important these basic skills are, irrespective of one's gender. Doing these chores doesn't make you less of an empowered person but more of an independent person. Being independent is the new empowerment. Making children learn how to be self reliable is more important. It will not make anyone less of a feminist but more of an equalist. According to me no one work is gender based, it's only and only about the ability of that person. Learning any skill makes us grow more as a person, whether it's coding or cooking. Both have their own importance, even the latter one is more of a necessity. Whether you are a men or a women when you'll be doing your stuff on your own, you'll set an example to all about how not to be dependent on others for your basic needs. If a women is doing household chores then it doesn't mean it's degrading her or down moraling her, it's simply mean she can handle all those stuff on her own. Most of our mothers are housewives and doing household chores doesn't make them less of a feminist, infact it shows how strong

Since the Taliban took power, they had repeatedly asserted that women’s rights were protected under Sharia, and kept repeating all the atrocities against women by removing them from public life, closing secondary schools for girls, and making an estimated 850,000 girls at risk of child marriage, and economic and sexual exploitation. The Taliban’s draconian, misogynistic form of rule did not reflect Afghan religion, culture or values. Talibani forces are destroying mosques, attacking religious scholors. Taliban is continuing to capture new areas and subsequently impose a regime that intends to take Afghanistan to old days under its rule, which means the non-existence of human values and even death punishment for petty crimes or violations of rules. while children have been forced to flee their homes, most of the time they are not fed healthily. They do not even know where their other food will come from. Children are dying because of starvation and malnutrition.

In past decades feminism it was seen as a movement people were fighting for  basic rights like right to vote , right for education etc for the womens. But nowadays it means generally means to support and encourage the womens to take part in those field and carreer that has been less travrelled by them like in military forces , etc. Well don't mind by womens taking part in those but the fact that the they should actively involved in household activites is important as because how small task the activities like cooking seems small to us but it is the most essential part of human life as because without a proper meal in a day anybody's mood could be off. Also is cleaning not done and proper hygiene is not maintained then ones family would have trouble with the health issues which if take place in huge number then a entire country be trouble.

Reclaming domestic activities such as gardning, cooking etc. only by femanists is unfair and unjust. 
Feminism is not about prefering females over males. It means having a chance of equal opportunities to grow and express in work and domestic environment. 
So asking feminists to reclaim domestic and household chores all by themselves is not fare. 
Secondly, men who claim to be feminists and pro women should not burden women to claim all responsibilities. 
So if all genders come and work together and no single gendre or specific faction of people to claim the responsibility alone the stereotypes are bashed and boundaries are broken. 
Whereas, saying that domestic chores are not empowering is wrong. It is the most unpaid and the most time consuming job. Many people also find it therapeutic. ","The Taliban 2.0 is not very different from its predecessor. Back in the 90s, the terror group in power was condemned globally for its inhumane and gory punishments and now after repeated promises of being more modern, the Taliban is back on its old tracks.The recent change in the regime of Afghanistan, not a single govt. around the world has recognised the Taliban as a legitimate government organisation.
Taliban's policies have driven millions into poverty and deprived women and girls of basic human liberties.The recent ban on university educations for women is the height of insanity. Unsc has recently called out Taliban and erged them to reverse the ban on women and aid workers and reverse it's policies towards educating women. 
Recently in the past few months more than 20 cases of flogging have been reported. People especially women were punished for not following their archaic and barbaric laws.
But the United Nations has been actively working with the Taliban. For instance on December 5th the UN send it's resident ambassadors to Kandhar to meet with the leaders, who are the one's making sure that the shariya law is being enforced.

So no I don't think so the UN should recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

5,1,Ashish Upadhyay ,"For:

Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering because these activities have often been assigned to women and seen as lesser or less important than traditionally male activities. By reclaiming these activities and valuing them as important and worthwhile, feminists can challenge and change societal norms and expectations around gender roles. Additionally, engaging in domestic activities can be personally empowering for women, as it allows them to take control of their own spaces and have agency in their own lives.

Against:

Feminists should not actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering because doing so reinforces traditional gender roles and reinforces the idea that certain tasks are ""women's work."" Instead of trying to reclaim these activities, feminists should work to break down gender roles and expectations altogether, and challenge the idea that certain activities are inherently gendered. Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also perpetuate the idea that women's worth is tied to their ability to perform these tasks, which is harmful and limiting.","The situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is a complex and perilous one, and has attracted significant attention in recent years. The United States has long had a significant immigrant population, with millions of people coming to the country in search of work, safety, and a better life. However, the rise of illegal activities at the border, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, and other forms of organized crime, has made it increasingly difficult and dangerous for immigrants to cross into the United States.

The impact of illegal activities at the border on both the United States and Mexico has been significant. In the United States, the influx of illegal immigrants has strained the country's resources, as well as leading to social and political tensions. In Mexico, the rise of organized crime at the border has contributed to violence and instability, as well as undermining the country's ability to control its own borders and protect its citizens.

There are a number of possible solutions to the problem of illegal activities at the border. One approach is to increase funding for border security and law enforcement, in order to better detect and prevent illegal crossings. Another approach is to reform immigration policies and laws, in order to make it easier for people to enter the United States legally and reduce the incentives for illegal immigration. Additionally, it may be necessary to address the root causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty and violence in countries of origin, in order to address the problem more effectively. Finally, it is important to ensure that the rights of immigrants, regardless of their legal status, are respected and protected.",Maybe

5,1,Aryan khudlain,"AGAINST THE MOTION :

It is important to recognize that the idea of reclaiming domestic activities as empowering for feminists may reinforce the notion that these activities are inherently feminine and therefore the responsibility of women. This can contribute to the gender binary and further entrench traditional gender roles. It is also important to consider the larger societal and economic structures that contribute to the unequal distribution of domestic labor and the unequal burden that often falls on women. Instead of reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists should work towards creating a more equitable society where domestic work is valued and shared more equally among all genders.

Additionally, framing domestic activities as empowering may not be relevant or applicable to all feminists and could potentially exclude or dismiss those who do not identify with or engage in these activities. It is important to recognize that empowerment can come from a variety of sources and can be experienced in different ways by different individuals. To truly empower feminists, it is necessary to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences, identities, and choices within the feminist movement

Furthermore, focusing on the empowerment of individual feminists through domestic activities may distract from larger structural issues that disproportionately impact marginalized groups within the feminist movement. While engaging in domestic activities may be empowering for some individuals, it is important to recognize that feminists also face systemic barriers and discrimination based on race, class, sexuality, ability, and other intersecting identities. Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering may not address these larger issues and could potentially reinforce privilege within the movement.
It is also worth considering the ways in which capitalism and consumerism have co-opted and commodified domestic activities, such as through the proliferation of home and garden magazines, cooking shows, and kitchen gadget infomercials. By reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists may inadvertently contribute to the capitalist exploitation of these activities and the exploitation of those who are marginalized and underpaid for their domestic labor.

Overall, while reclaiming domestic activities as empowering may be meaningful and beneficial for some feminists, it is important to recognize that this may not be the case for all feminists and to consider the potential limitations and drawbacks of this approach.
","The situation at the US-Mexico border, where many immigrants are locked between the two countries, is a serious and perilous one that requires urgent attention and action. The rise of illegal activities, including human trafficking and smuggling, at the border has had significant and negative impacts on both the United States and Mexico.

One major issue is the exploitation and abuse of immigrants by criminal organizations and smugglers. Many immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented, are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to their lack of legal status and protections. They may be subject to abuse and mistreatment by smugglers and traffickers, who may take advantage of their desperation and willingness to pay for passage to the United States. This exploitation can have serious consequences, including physical and sexual abuse, debt bondage, and even death.

The rise of illegal activities at the border has also had negative impacts on the United States and Mexico. In the United States, it has contributed to a significant increase in border crossings, which has strained resources and caused backlogs in the immigration system. It has also fueled tensions and political polarization over immigration policy. In Mexico, the rise of illegal activities at the border has contributed to violence and insecurity in border regions, as well as corruption and abuse by authorities.

To address this problem, there are several possible solutions that could be implemented. One approach is to strengthen border security and enforcement measures to deter illegal crossings and reduce the power and influence of criminal organizations. This could include improving infrastructure and technology at the border, as well as increasing resources and personnel.

Another approach is to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, conflict, and persecution, by addressing these issues in countries of origin. This could involve providing development assistance, addressing human rights abuses, and working to address the underlying causes of conflict and instability.

Finally, it is important to ensure that the rights and dignity of immigrants are respected and protected, regardless of their legal status. This could involve providing access to legal representation and due process, as well as addressing conditions in detention facilities and ensuring that immigrants are treated with dignity and respect.

Overall, the situation at the US-Mexico border is a complex and multifaceted one that requires a comprehensive and holistic approach to address the root causes of immigration and protect the rights and dignity of immigrants.",False

Even men nowadays do all the household chores on their own especially when their wife is a working professional. They maintain the whole house and does all the work which were once categorised as a women's job.
It's just same as going out and earning for the family. It's just doing something for our loved ones without any payment rather than doing stuff for a MNC which pays you a good amount. People should also understand that domestic work is also a part of women empowerment. Maintaining and looking after one's house doesn't makes a woman weak but gives her confidence and a sense of responsibility. There is a thinking in our society that if a woman works in her house is against the women empowerment view. Some so called feminists also does the same and made a boundary in between women and domestic activities thinking that it's empowering women rights. But in reality it's like taking away the most important right of a woman's significance fr the start of life. One should not take away the females from their houses in the name of women empowerment.

No laws, no rules, no limits and no humanity left there. Talibanis are doing whatever they like even killing people, kidnapping women, eventually humiliating the Afghans.

5,1,Prajwal,"We should understand that being financially independent is a part of empowerment, not empowerment itself. Domestic activities should also be considered empowering, they also empower women. Women empowerment is one of the most brewing topics these days. People with literally zero knowledge are commenting upon it. Empowerment comes from within, it is whatever you feel empowered doing, not something the society wants you to do to be considered empowered. Empower means 'to give delegate power and authority'. It means to be able to live your life how you want, to be able to take your decisions yourself and not with someone else's interference. A person who chooses to be a housewife and a financially independent woman, both are equally empowered. A woman who can do whatever she wants should be termed as empowered, not one who earns a handsome amount of money. For example, if a woman earns a good amount of money but is not allowed to take her decisions herself, she is not empowered. There are many women who simply don't want to work but take care of their children or households, they are also empowered. So, domestic activities should also be considered empowering. Feminists should always think of empowerment in a broader sense, they should not limit it to a few activities. Everyone should think twice before giving someone a tag as empowered or unempowered. In India, there are a lot of women who are housewives. Now if we consider it that way, then all these women are unempowered, but they are actually not. Feminists should recall what is called as being empowered. It is a very broad topic and does not include something that you must follow to be called empowered.

Focusing the Asian patriarchal society like Sri Lanka, women’s liberation is decided by gender disparities which emerged through socialization process, internalizing social norms, cultural values and expectations. Hence, in the traditional society, women were discriminated from high positions in society, political leadership, decision making and economic top management. However, with the spreading out of feminist ideas and changes that took place in Sri Lanka after independence of the country, some educated women started to address women’s issues and developed a discourse regarding women’s liberation in the contemporary society. The major objective of this study is to examine what are the challenges that women face in getting their socio-economic and political liberation in Sri Lanka, and to investigate how feminists contribute to achieve equal rights for women in the country. The study was based on secondary data gathered from literature surveys which are directly related to the issues addressed in this study. The study revealed that the factors affect discrimination of women from socio-economic and political sectors in contrast to males in the society. In Sri Lanka, traditional women have much less social, economic and political and domestic power than men. However, after independence, successive governments have devoted greatly to education, health and welfare programs. Due to this situation, the status of women in Sri Lanka has changed dramatically. At the same time, feminist scholars are showing that, women play a significant role in the family as homemakers and working women’s contribution to the economic development of the country. Furthermore, they have emphasized the importance of equal rights of women in socio-economic and political sectors as well as women’s liberation against the patriarchal views in the society.

The Taliban in Afghanistan
The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, twenty years after their ouster by U.S. troops. Under their harsh rule, they have cracked down on women’s rights and neglected basic services.

Taliban fighters hold a flag for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in August 2022. 
    

The Islamic fundamentalist group returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging an insurgency against the U.S.-backed government in Kabul since 2001.
The group has struggled to form a functioning government that can provide health services and economic opportunities to Afghans.
The Taliban maintain close ties with al-Qaeda. Analysts are concerned that the Taliban could provide it with safe haven and allow it to launch international terrorist attacks from Afghan soil.
Introduction
The Taliban are a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. 

Following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the original regime in 2001, the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory less than ten years after their ouster. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. The group’s swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.

The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.

It shows that that feminist activity has sky rocketed and it affects worldwide.

Now there is another motive behind why women who works still do housework, which is not talked by many feminist. I asked my mother why she do the housework even though dad ask her to hire helping person for cooking . My mother said she likes to cook for the family and dont want to give this role to any person. In my personal experience domestic activities can be empowering and there are various examples around us one of the example lalijit papad which every ones knows of . As start up culture is in boom in India and if you are good in cooking you can open an restraunt or if you dont have enough money you can open an home kitchen or cloud kitchen . In this age of technology and start up culture no can say that domestic activities cannot attain any results and we can confidently say that even if women is working doing household activities its to support her family and if that person has  right amount of skills she can earn a lot .

5,1,Chirag Saini ,"There are several arguments that can be made against the motion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities, such as gardening and cooking, as empowering.

One argument is that while domestic activities can be fulfilling and rewarding for some individuals, they are not necessarily empowering for everyone. Some people may not enjoy these activities, or may not have the time or resources to engage in them. Forcing all feminists to engage in domestic activities may create additional burdens and expectations that are not desired or feasible for everyone.

Another argument is that focusing on domestic activities as a means of empowerment may reinforce traditional gender roles and expectations, rather than challenging them. By valorizing domestic activities as inherently feminist, we may be replicating the idea that certain activities are ""women's work"" and should be prioritized by feminists.","The UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban because a lot of nations comprises the UN which does not stand for the human rights violations which are committed by the Taliban under their regime in Afghanistan.  
Recognizing such rule will empower multiple other like minded regimes with a template on how to get away by committing heinous crimes.
Previously when they wanted to shift the attention from their oppression against women, they allowed the women in the country to study in schools and colleges but recently they have backtracked from their decision and again banned education for women. Such examples clearly exhibit the mindset of these organizations.
The mishandling of covid-19 in the country because of their poor governance has led to multiple deaths in the country leading to a catastrophic failure of governance on every level.
Soon after the pandemic, the country plunged into famine and even when a lot of global superpowers such as India donated food products such as wheat for the people of Afghanistan, a lot of it was illegally stocked up solely for the influential Talibani individuals. 
The giant global body such as the UN can not and must not stand with such corrupted regimes which do not serve the people but rather serve themselves.

5,1,Aditya Pandey ,"With new definitions of feminism coming out every second day and new movements taking place in the name of revolution and women, feminism has segregated the revolutionaries among themselves. It has become a common notion among people that activities such as cooking and gardening classify women as second class citizen to men, which according to me, is a very harmful discourse in itself. When people talk about this idea of feminism, they forget that feminism includes women who CHOOSE to be stay-at-home moms, they forget about the women who CHOOSE to nurture their family instead of taking strides in their career, and they forget women who CHOOSE that getting married at 20 after being abused for the last 18 years. Choose here, is the keyword. The idea of feminism that grows from this thought forgets to include disabled, transgender and marginal women into the community. What is wrong with this idea, you may ask. But it is the fact that the whole idea of feminism is based on bringing women to become equal with men and not supposed to create boundaries between women based upon what they choose to do with their lives. There are women cooking in shelter homes to feed the needy, women in poultry farms collecting eggs to make sure that her children have breakfast, women rearing sheeps to make sure that the kitchen has enough vegetables. To be able to choose the life you want for yourself is the core idea of feminism. It is about having the choice, free from the implications and expectations of the society. For every woman out there, there is a separate feminism that they have in their hearts. It might not be going to office and being on the next Forbes 100 list but that does not make it less important or less real.","Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021. It became a well known fact that the governance in Afghanistan crumbled under their rule. The position of women and non-Muslim residents deteriorated.

The rule of Taliban in Afghanistan has led to several cases of Human Rights violation. No opposing press reports, protestors or activists are allowed in public. Women have been prohibited from working. Little girls are not allowed to attend schools. Rigid Islamic Laws have taken the place of the constitution. With the financial condition of Afghanistan worsening and a huge part of the population suffering from hunger, Taliban has also proved to be ineffective in the economic growth of Afghanistan.

These household activities were usually and mostly done by women so they are made to categorized as a women’s work but if the future generation looks upon his /her father or other males in their home doing all such activities.I think for the coming future generations domestic work will always be categorized gender neutral and that would be a major achievement for feminism.
Nowadays jokes on women are mostly anti feminist and derogatory which i have seen people nowadays find cool and funny even the women find it funny when women are called as dishwasher or women getting dominated by a man who works for living and the women has to do household work and handle the children.

These people’s will to move away from their native land for earning a better lifestyle has increased the number of immigrants from Asian countries 
This resulted in strict rules to control their number. The high rate of visa rejections resulted in illegal immigrants and the lack of border force at the US-Mexico border made the US their preferred place to settle.
People travel to countries like South America that have high visa acceptance like Columbia and traveling countries, crossing borders they cross the Panama canal to reach Mexico. The whole journey is on foot,  hiding from soldiers and police. These areas are under the high influence of Mafias who shoot anyone just to loot them. Traveling on such a route has a mortality rate of 60%, but still, people prefer to immigrate illegally.
They may have entered the US illegally but end up living a life struggling for survival and hiding away like thieves from the police authorities. They can’t report anything to the police and people exploit them, making them work for low wages. The only way they can settle in the US is to marry a US citizen.
These people usually indulge in illegal activities and this gives rise to criminal activities in the US. They often join the mafias and work for them illegally to spread terror.
The reason this illegal route is named “DONKEY” can be truly justified.
To overcome this,  people must be made aware of their life after the “DONKEY” route, they are often unaware of the route and the high risk and mortality rate.

5,1,Abhay sharma ,"Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.
It is certainly true that domestic activities, such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and household members, have historically been considered the domain of women and have often been undervalued and underpaid. Many feminists believe that these activities should be valued as important and valuable work and that men and women should share the burden of domestic responsibilities more equally. Reclaiming domestic activities can be a way for feminists to challenge traditional gender roles and to advocate for more equitable distribution of labor within households and families. It can also be a way for feminists to resist the stereotype that women are only fit for domestic work and to assert their right to pursue other interests and activities outside the home.","The situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is a complex and multifaceted issue that involves a range of economic, social, and political factors. Many immigrants who seek to enter the United States through the southern border do so because they are fleeing poverty, violence, and persecution in their home countries and hope to find a better life in the United States. However, the journey to the border can be dangerous and unpredictable, and many immigrants face a variety of challenges and risks along the way.

One significant issue is the rise of illegal activities at the border, such as human smuggling and drug trafficking, which can put immigrants at risk of exploitation and abuse. These activities can also have a negative impact on both the United States and Mexico, as they can contribute to crime and violence in border communities and undermine the rule of law.

There are a number of potential solutions that could address the situation of immigrants at the border and mitigate the negative impacts of illegal activities. These could include:

Improving conditions in countries of origin: This could involve addressing the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, violence, and persecution, and providing development assistance to help people build better lives in their home countries.

Providing legal avenues for immigration: By creating more legal channels for immigration, governments can help reduce the demand for illegal routes and reduce the risks associated with illegal crossings. This could include increasing the number of visas available for immigrants, creating temporary worker programs, and offering asylum to those who are fleeing persecution.

Enhancing border security: This could involve increasing resources and personnel at the border, improving technology and infrastructure, and working with Mexico to address illegal activities that take place on the Mexican side of the border.

Providing assistance to immigrants: Governments can also provide support and assistance to immigrants who are in need, including temporary housing, healthcare, education, and other services. This could help reduce the burden on border communities and ensure that immigrants are treated with dignity and respect.",Maybe

5,1,Priyanshi Jain ,"Feminism was started so that women who were not treated as an equal to men can practice their rights of gender equality. But in the recent time the term feminism is being misused in more than one ways. In earlier times it was believed that women are born to do household chores and men to earn for the family. But now, fortunately, times have changed and even men contribute in all the domestic activities. We even find househusbands these days which is a great progress. But this movement is being misused these days. Women have started believing that they don't have to do any of the domestic work, it's not their responsibility. I believe that it is responsibility of both the genders to contribute equally in all the domestic activities. If men are realizing that they have to do the household work as well then women should also understand that they don't have to give up the responsibility entirely. That they have to share it with their partner. I would say that doing household work doesn't make women any less important than men and instead it gives them their own identity as an independent person who can manage everything from household to office work by themselves. I would say that women should not start doing the whole of the domestic work by themselves but should share it with their partner. I have seen some women who have cooking or some other domestic work astheir hobby but they don't pursue it in the name of feminism so that is something which need to change in the society. Although some families are still conservative and they believe that women should do the domestic chores especially the kitchen chores. People like these also need to be enlightened about the role of men and women as an equal in the household work and that it is not solely the responsibility of women. But women also need to reclaim their position in domestic activities and they should not at least fully give up their responsibility in the household chores.","The Taliban are a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. 

Given the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, should UN recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban?The Taliban also threaten gains made in Afghans’ standards of living over the two decades after the U.S. invasion. The country’s economic situation has worsened since their takeover, with the United Nations estimating that almost all Afghans could be living in poverty by mid-2022.Moreover, international observers remain concerned that the Taliban support terrorist organizations, particularly al-Qaeda, posing a threat to regional and international security. The United States invaded Afghanistan after it refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Under the Taliban’s rule, Afghanistan could become a safe haven for terrorists capable of launching attacks against the United States and its allies, experts say, despite Taliban statements that “Afghanistan’s soil will not be used against the security of any other country.”
The takeover was widely criticized by the international community, and no countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the new regime, despite nominally maintaining relations with Afghanistan. The Taliban has aggressively campaigned for international recognition since the takeover. Several countries have vowed never to recognize the Islamic Emirate, and others have said they will do so only if human rights are respected.The Taliban previously ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and received limited diplomatic recognition, with the United Nations and most countries continuing to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan, which the Taliban had reduced to a rump state.",False
5,1,Anusha Dwivedi,"I feel like feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. As we know women have always been considered weaker and not equal to men in almost all aspects except domestic work. Even nowadays u can hear many people saying that men can't handle domestic activities as well as women because many people believe that womem were born for it and hence activities like cooking, gardening etc. are often considered as feminine activities.
Our society consider these activities as leisure activities. According to me an empowering activity is anything that would make you feel more confident and make you feel independent. I think domestic activities do make you independent atleast in terms that you won't have to depend on someone else for your basic household chores. I feel like feminists should reclaim domestic activities as empowering because some of the women might choose to stay home and do the domestic work and i feel, that should not make such women feel any less empowered than the women who are earning or running a buisness. Domestic activities should be considered empowering activities because they can also make you independent in terms of money as they can be turned into small scale buisness. Feminism is about making people believe that women and men are equal and i feel that, to do so it is not necessary to do all the activities that are considered manly according to our society but it can also be done by changing people's mindset that domestic work which is considered as a women's work apparently, is nothing less than a 9-5 job and it requires skill and this we can do by reclaiming domestic activities as empowering.","The southwestern States that share a border with Mexico–Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California are put under strain as they must process illegal immigrants caught with illegal drugs.

5,1,Ayush Saraswat,"Modern feminism's major objective is to raise voice in support of women rights and opportunities. The methods and subsidiary objectives might differ depending on different cultures and administrative policies but the main idea remains the same. Now to answer the main question presented ; No, feminists should not reclaim household activities as women empowerment. This is primarily because of the less relevance and importance of the subject relative to the other issues present in the society. For instance, In India, major states like Rajasthan and Haryana have very bad sex-ratio, while Delhi is infamously known as the rape capital of the country. Feminists need to actively raise voice on these topics so suddenly shifting the focus on percieving household activities as Women empowerment will be a bad utilisation of resources. Aside from this, the Indian society is still quite rudimentary regarding their treatment with women, doing as stated in the question brings a softness to the argument and does not help in changing the rudimentary mindset of the society,rather it might lay an opposite effect. Besides this, most of the household activities are essential for survival and should be practised by evwryone irrelevant of the gender of the person. To conclude, Household activities are respectable and some of them can also be pursued as a profession,but actively reclaiming them as women empowerment does not effectively achieve anything and makes the approach too passive.","No, United Nations should not recognise Islamic Emirates of Taliban as of now. Though many reasons can be stated in support of this argument I would like to draw attention to some primary reasons, most important of them being the fundamentals of Taliban's governance. It can be easily derived from public intervies that Taliban's primary aim is to restore the Islamic culture and the Sharia law and most of the administrative decisions revolve around that idea instead of proper debate and discussion.The laws of a legislature should be based on fundamental human rights and not religious texts.Also, Taliban's statements regarding women have been very contradictive. The officials say that women are allowed to get education but all the secondary schools for girls are closed throughout the country. Women who were in government jobs before are paid but are not allowed to join the workforce in any way. The restrictions applied on women like forcing th to be completely covered and restrictions on travelling for long distances  without the company of a male relative are still not justified in any way by the administration. Apart from this, Taliban's government still has not taken any considerable action to stabilize the country's falling economy. The degree of adversity of Afghanistan's economic situation is evident from the latest United Nations report which says that more than half of the country's population is dependent on the UN worldwide food programme to survive. Moreover, we know that Taliban in the past has failed miserably to form a  government which values human rights while freely instigating acts of terrorism on innocent civilians. Taliban's links with other terrorist organisations have been confirmed repeatedly and though their rule has established a temporary peace in the nation, it is nothing but the result of violence and war in itself. One of the major factors leading to Taliban's rise was not its efficiency in governance but the incompetence of its predecessors. All these reasons effectively make the Islamic emirates of Taliban a centre of scrutiny and it is a wise decision to not recognise them as of now.",False
46,0,Yash,"Feminism is the belief in equal rights and opportunities for all genders. This includes challenging and dismantling traditional gender roles that have historically disadvantaged and oppressed women. One way to challenge and subvert these traditional gender roles is by actively reclaiming domestic activities, such as gardening and cooking, as empowering and important endeavors.

Traditionally, these domestic activities have been associated with femininity and assigned to women as their primary responsibilities. By actively engaging in and valuing these activities, feminists can challenge the notion that they are inferior or less important than ""masculine"" pursuits.

Furthermore, domestic activities such as gardening, and cooking can be incredibly rewarding and empowering in and of themselves. They allow individuals to take control of their own sustenance and well-being and can provide a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.

Overall, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering is a way for feminists to challenge and subvert traditional gender roles, and to assert the value and importance of all types of work and pursuits.



","The situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is certainly perilous. Many immigrants, particularly those from Central America, are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries and are seeking safety and a better life in the United States. However, they often face difficult and dangerous journeys to reach the border, and once there, they may be held in detention facilities that are overcrowded and lack adequate resources and support.

The rise of illegal activities, such as human smuggling and drug trafficking, has exacerbated the problem and has had a negative impact on both the United States and Mexico. These activities often exploit immigrants and put them at risk, and they also contribute to crime and instability in both countries.

There are several potential solutions to this problem. One is to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty and violence, in the countries of origin. This could involve investing in development and governance programs, as well as providing assistance to refugees. Another solution is to improve the legal pathways for immigration, such as by increasing the number of visas available or streamlining the application process. Additionally, improving conditions in detention facilities and providing more support for immigrants after they are released could also be helpful.

5,1,Tanish Verma,"“Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering”
Tanish Verma : For the Motion

The Dictionary defines  feminist as someone who supports equal rights for women or a person who supports or engages in feminism. And it will be a good idea here to understand feminism. Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes especially of women. Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, right to work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter contracts, have equal rights within marriage and equality of service rules. 
Now the question is if women reclaim domestic activities such as cooking, gardening, knitting etc then is it women empowerment or a step backwards in women’s progress. And I feel that when women start reclaiming domesticity, it is not only a step towards self-sufficiency but also inching closer to empowerment. Because empowerment allows us to throw aside the shackles of slavery… and slavery to anything that discriminates women unjustly. Differences based of physiology of man and woman can never and should never be the reason for discrimination. After all the woman as a mother brings forth the new generation into life.  The lack of these domestic skills is not empowering, and I see it as something that holds not only women but also the society back from “real power”.
I think reclaiming domesticity simply because it is fun, why not encourage it because it is smart and empowering. And this isn’t just about women either. Men and women need to reclaim domesticity. It is a powerful life choice that makes them more self-reliant and in control of their finances and future. Let women be educated and don’t discriminate them anywhere anyway. It is actually incredibly sad when women are referred to as weaker sex. The girl child of today is the mother of tomorrow and government of India realised this started campaigns like “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao”. And the recent ban on University education by Taliban on women must be strongly disproved in all forms.  
Reclaiming domesticity is about standing up and telling society that women are no longer lesser mortals. They are equally strong if not more than the men, example of Queen of Jhansi, Laxmi Bai is known to all. Apart from this, the successful examples of Kiran Majumdar Shaw of Biocon, Falguni Sanjay Nayar of Nykaa, Vandana Luthra of VLCC, Indira Nooyi of Pepsi, Jaswantiben Jamnadas Popat of Lijjat Papad, and many more are all women in front of us. So reclaiming domestic activities will surely empower women in true sense.

","Given the recent change of government in Afghanistan  and its annexation by the Taliban , should UN recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban? Justify your answer sufficiently.
Tanish Verma

The question of recognizing the Taliban is not only a test of the integrity of international law but also an intriguing one.
August 2021, when Taliban proclaimed itself the ruler of Afghanistan after annexing it, marked the end of 2 decades of democratic governance. The Taliban, since then craves for international recognition by the United Nations.  However, the Taliban have serious legitimacy issues both at domestic and international fronts. Domestically, the Taliban have faced several protests  across the country which means there is nationwide resentment to their rule. At the international platform, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed a resolution in March 2020, declaring that they would neither recognize nor support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  And most importantly, this was reinforced by another resolution in August 2021 (after Taliban’s self-proclamation) demanding an inclusive government and respect for human rights. And this move was supported by all member of the UNSC. 
International recognition by UN requires meeting four conditions: (1) effective control; (2) popular support and domestic legitimacy; (3) permanence and stability; and (4) ability and willingness to fulfil international obligations. 
The Taliban seized Afghanistan by force and have begun to ensure their control, not through elections, but through the crime of ethnic cleansing by forcing mass evacuation of dissidents. I feel, the move by UN, is right because Taliban’s recognition would not only undermine the right to self-determination of Afghans but also internationally embolden similar terrorist organizations around the world to topple governments and then demand international recognition. 
And further, instead of inclusion of women in government and society, the Taliban removed the Ministry of Women and replaced it with the Ministry of Amr Bil Maruf, which conducts religious and moral policing. More than one million girls have been barred from attending high schools over the past year, despite international condemnation and promises from the Taliban for normalcy. None other than, the UN Secretary-General Mr. Antonio Guterrres too requested for normalcy. What to talk of normalcy, the situation got further aggravated by the recent ban on University education for girls which definitely is a cold murder of women’s rights.
International human rights laws oblige the Taliban to create favourable conditions for peace, inclusion, security, human rights and economic recovery which they did not fulfil. I want to say that none of the four conditions are sufficiently met. Therefore I say that UN should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.",False

First of all the term, Feminism has become a lot more convoluted in recent times. If we went by the actual definition of feminism, the problem of discarding or reclaiming certain activities as empowering or not would never exist. In my opinion, domestic activities like cooking are important if someone (both men and women) doesn't like it they would have to find a workaround. But when it comes to labeling them as empowering it's quite weird. These activities can be labeled hobbies or chores but they have nothing to do with being empowering. There should be discussions about other important topics regarding feminism such as equality in workplaces and equal laws for protection against harassment. 
If we carefully analyze the domestic abilities we would find that they don't need to be gender-specific. They should be undertaken with stride and shouldn't be looked down upon as restrictive or forbidding. Given the above, I would like to summarize that domestic tasks should not belong in the realm of discussions about feminism and empowerment. Accepting them without bringing them into such an important discussion about
feminism. All genders should share these responsibilities equally. ",The Taliban situation is much more complex than we all can fathom. The UN is not the holy peacekeeping force that will prevent another World War. These opening lines are what I generally think about the topic. UN in this situation can either delay the recognition indefinitely or just grant it.  It all depends on the capabilities of the present leaders. The choices matter only for the precedent it sets. Taliban's occupation of Afghanistan is against many laws and norms of the UN but the institution cannot do anything about it now as they couldn't have done anything about it when it was happening so openly. We can have an open conversation about the same on humanitarian grounds. When it comes to the recognition question things have to move in certain directions eventually. All clue point to the Taliban getting their say eventually. The UN should work on the prevention of such future annexations.

46,0,Manish,"A word which refers to equality, a word which refers to empowerment, a movement which wast started for the betterment of the situation of females. The word is none other than feminism. The sole meaning of feminism revolves around giving equal opportunity/rights to female gender. It is one of the most trending topic of recent times. Unfortunately the word is getting abused, people started manupulating the real meaning of feminism according to their need. Which is portraying the wrong message to the society. Mostly I am gonna talk on situations of women in india. So at ancient times, women were given equal opportunity to earn and take care of household . But due to some people which considered to be the upper cast. They started manipulating the theories to satisfy their male ego. They made a norm that men will go outside of home to earn, to fight for food and women will take care of house, kids and other household chores. Till one point of time their is nothing wrong in it , because if both parents will start going outside of home to earn, how they will raise their kids, how they will take care of them. To maintain a healthy lifestyle or healthy relations elder ones of the family must have their eye on everything related to family. But due to this sacrifise of female , men have started pressuring, degrading, demotivating women which is completly wrong . So in result movement like feminism is on its peak. But nowadays some people have misinterpretted this term and started abusing it in the name of modernism. We are copying western culture and giving it the name of mordernism it is not correct because the condition in india and conditions in any other country have alot of diffrence. My simple take on this topic is doing household chores also be termed as empowerment because if you have a family to take care like kids and parents. They need food, care on regular basis. So in order to take care of them a person should always be physically present with them who can be male or female. If male partner is earning good amount so why female needs to go out? I am not saying ki only male partner have right to earn for family , iam just saying , if your family is getting every resource from a partner then it should be a duty of other partner to take care of other things which require to live a happy and peacefull life. See one have to take charge over these household chores either male or female. If both do not want to take charge, So they can hire a person who can do these work for them . Nowadays feminist have started doing all these household chores as disrespect which is completely wrong , So  End of discussion is ""Feminists can actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering."" ","First we should talk about why they started migrating illegaly to usa . Since 2020, a combination of growing violence across Mexico and a worsening economy has led to the first jump in Mexican migration in a decade. The current situation is hundreds of migrants are camping in the cold at Mexico’s northern border over Christmas, hoping for a slight reversal in restrictions imposed by the US as they endure the bite of a winter storm ravaging the region. The condition at mexicos northern border is worse , the problem needed to be solved immediately because it can take lives of thousands of innocents as well. Some of these illegal immigrants have started smuggling illegals drugs, weapons. Which can harm the peace and well being of usa.
There are more than 11 million unauthorised immigrants living in the USA. Many Americans believe that Mexican immigrants are a drain on the economy. They believe that migrant workers keep wages low which affects Americans.
The possible solution for this problem can be taken by mexican government, to ensure that thier citizens getting proper resources like education, food, employement to live thier life happily.

Women are an integral part of society just like men .for a long time they were confined to walls of their homes but now women have started standing out for their rights and they are now raising their voice. The society has always tried to subjugate them . But in this 21 St century they have come out more confident , more strong but when it comes to reclaiming domestic activities , i think everyone should do their work on their own ...it's not about women or men ...both should contribute in domestic activites . Reclaiming domestic activites is not empowerment of women ...it's when both the genders contribute equally and do not question each other on their decisions . When women  take their decisions on their own they will become empowered .they must be given  equal opportunity to make their decisions and participate independently whether it is workplace or home .

5,1,Abhijeet kumar,I am in support to this motion I also think that they should be given choice to do what they want to do not to just making a point that the girls who does jobs or other works outside of house are supporting feminism I girl can even support feminism if she is housemaker also or anything else I don't think like domestic or corporate activities define that you are a feminist in past when feminism had started at that time girls were not allowed to go out of their houses and do works that's at that time many female and also some male demanded for equality for females that they named as feminism and the person who believed it went out of their houses doing jobs etc these was things at that time but at present I think they should be given choice to decide what they wanna do jobs fine if they wanna do household activities it's totally fine they shouldn't be forced in any way by anyone by putting pressure of feminism on them they who doe outside jobs are only supporting feminism. I just believe everyone should be given choice to do what they want to do happily.,"Change in government in Afghanistan and it's annexation by the Taliban I don't think it's good for the people of Afghanistan because The Taliban is already a terrorist group and a country which is ruled by terrorist by using force isn't a good thing they have started restricting people by banning girls to study they aren't allowed to go to school or universities they can't even go out without their brother,father or husband .they are restricted to wear burqa. They have banned makeup for women .they have also banned many things for all their citizen like listening to music is banned , TV is banned , shaving is banned for male , even forcing people to change their name to Islamic ones these all are things are basic amenities of people they are treating them so much Inhuman and no government is good that can't keep there people happy atleast majority they restricting them so much like north Korea and the day tolerance became zero for people they will threw this government because after a point people doesn't even care for there life and just opposes.and I hope things get good there.",False
46,0,SANDEEP KUMAR ,"I believe yes the people who support some ideology they should also participate actively in household works whether it's a MAN or WOMAN . Because as the people supporting their own ideology, also participate actively in empowering they forget that the things people used to do including household work is not a big issue but it had been made by people around us yes I agree that some of them genuinely face it that they don't get equal salary as others or equal opportunities but it just have emerged as a big issue .
Supporting it is not bad but doing big rallies , doing poster stuff is not required also . If the people working in average facilities they will be getting benefits like in coporate and such in other sectors but making it a big issue and shouting and fighting aggressively is not the solution  - peace solution is the best answer by making aware by advertising, by finding people who are under these issues and solving it by supporting them , leading case in courts so to get a solid approved by law .Is it bad to lead at your own home obviously no so doing your household work is not a big issue and supporting the man or women at home is the thing which will make us aware that it's a part of our daily routine as they actively do empowering of other issues. So at last i would like to conclude that yes actively participating and doing domestic work as empowering should be followed and done by the people who support any ideology who are known as feminists.","Taliban had ruled earlier from 1996-2001 and after the indulgence of US armed forces for more than 20 years to remove Taliban from Afghanistan which they weren't successful at .

Countries such as Australia , Bangladesh, Canada, France and many other countries are not ready to accept the ISLAMIC EMIRATE OF TALIBAN. The reason behind it is that the current government is not in support to Human rights and  plus they are applying their own laws ""Sharia laws"" . Even the the president of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani didn't gave any answer to the media too after the annexation and had flewed to the neighbouring country Tajikistan But UN is allowing Afghan representative Ghulam M. Isaczai to present the views and different issues of Afghanistan on behalf of only previous government which was 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and not the Taliban govt .UN should also not accept the Taliban govt because it is not even providing equal opportunity to each women who wants to work earlier they had allowed in the pressure of the world power but now again they have taken the right back from the women out there in Afghanistan. Even the country's female population is not allowed to wear or go out on their ease ,The education is not being provided upto the basic level also so how can a country like this with all restrictions will develop and why will other countries will invest in the country's resources.At last I want to say the UN should not recognise the new ruling ISLAMIC EMIRATE OF TALIBAN .",False
5,1,Yachna Saxena,"FOR THE MOTION 
Since the evolution of mankind started male and female roles have been stereotyped. Men turned towards more active hunting and gathering roles while females because of their smaller stature turned to more ""domestic"" tasks like cooking, gardening, etc. Over time, chauvinistic and neanderthal ideas of being stronger and bigger took prejudice over the more skill and patience requiring tasks that women have always accomplished. We often overlook how difficult even small tasks can be when they don't make an explosive impact spontaneously. An example is how we see the destruction of something as significant and even impressive occasionally, but we fail to see how infuriating a small task like threading a needle can be. In that sense, we as a society have been pushing women on the back burner for centuries now, the fact that we even see the preparation of food which is something so fundamental and so essential, as feminine is a letdown in itself. But at the end of the day, it is tasks like cooking and cleaning that keep us functioning in our day-to-day life. No matter what point in human history we may be at. Inadvertently, in this time of progression and in this male-dominated working culture, women who try to equate themselves to their male counterparts end up shying away from the things that make them so much more because of the notion that basic tasks like this that keep us functioning are feminine and make them weak. While in reality this gives them the power to be a fully functioning individual and frees them from relying on anyone or anything to live and exist on their own without the stress of waiting for a small task to be done for them. I think it is imperative to teach young women that while they have the strength to move mountains, they have the gentleness and dexterity it takes to hold up a house of cards, and that is never a weakness. ","Given the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, the UN should recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. 

The United Nations is a body that exists to prevent crimes against humanity. When we talk about the recent change of government in Afghanistan, we cannot deny the amount of bloodshed and human sacrifice that has taken place. 

Since the Taliban took a stronghold in Afghanistan the public has been suffering immensely, even after the formal intervention by the US from 7 October 2001. Following the Taliban's refusal to hand over Osama Bin Laden and close down terrorist training camps, the United States launched airstrikes against Al-Qaeda and Taliban targets in Afghanistan with the support of allies. By the time the U.S. and NATO combat mission formally ended in December 2014, the 13-year Afghanistan War had become the longest war ever fought by the United States.

 According to the United States Institution of Peace,  The American war in Afghanistan incurred staggering costs — for the United States, Afghans, and others — over two decades. The U.S. government spent $2.3 trillion, and the war led to the deaths of 2,324 U.S. military personnel, 3,917 U.S. contractors, and 1,144 allied troops. 70,000 Afghan military and police deaths, 46,319 Afghan civilians (although that is likely a significant underestimation), and some 53,000 opposition fighters killed. Almost 67,000 other people were killed in Pakistan in relation to the Afghan war. 

 To turn a blind eye to all the wrongdoing that has happened is a crime in itself. This is not something a single country can handle. It's time for the world as a collective to speak up against all of the injustice and violence happening. 

Another task of the UN is to provide relief to countries where people are struggling. But if the Islamic Emirate of Taliban isn't recognized as a country, then there will also be no relief sent to the public. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. In Afghanistan, poverty is widespread in rural and urban areas. They cannot possibly stay functioning long like this. As of now, Since the Taliban's August 2021 takeover of Afghanistan, they have ratcheted up restrictions on women and girls. These restrictions include limitations on employment, education, public interactions, and other fundamental rights such as access to justice. Not only is this a step back for them as a country, but it's also a step back for all of humanity. Their economy was already on the verge of giving out. Doing this will further pummel them into ruin.

 And if we don't as a whole recognize them as a problem and intervene, we will remain a witness to one of the worst crimes against humanity in modern history. Recognizing them will not give them any power, it will only bring light to their wrongdoings and give us space to intervene.

5,1,Tejas,"well, yes feminist should actively reclaim domestic actvities as empowering. 
First of all how empowerment is related to domestic work and professional work. Empowerment basically means becoming stronger and more confident. 
one can feel weak and underconfident while doing professional work like corporate jobs also. It really doesnt have  anything to do with gender too.
Also domestic work can be empowering for many women and men too. If we talk about domestic workers near us like our housemaid, street sweepers etc its empowering 
for them bcz it gives them employment and money.
the core concept of feminism is women should have same rights and oppurtunities as men, but it really doesnt mean that FEMISNIST should 
not actively participate in domestic work just bcz they feel this is not empowering them. Domestic work such as cooking and gardening can be done by both of the genders so it can
 be done by FEMINISTS also. feminist demand equal rights and oppurtinities only in the field of education, non menial jobs but 
not in the field of occupations like sewer cleaning, truck drivers, firefighters, metal workers, carpenters, electricians etc..

for an instance, today in india many educated and the so called feminist choose not to work bcz according to them its the man duty to work and earn but on the other hand they also believe in sharing of household and domestic work which is sheer level of hypocrisy.
so basically, what i want to convey is that the work be it domestic and professional, it is really not subjugated to genders and we should 
not label them as empowering or non empowering.","well thats a tough one.
 if we talk from india perspective so yes UN should recognise islamic emirate of taliban. India has invested nearly 3 billion dollar in afghanistan which was for betterment of Afghanistan and its ppl, it really doesnt have to do anything with the type of govt there, so it can be huge loss for a country like india and more importantly afg.
 ind and afg share a long trustworthy relationship not from just 70 or 75 yrs but since the time of maurya empire. as we all know afg is a very socially backward country with least amount of social devolpment. its gdp is on the verge of collapsing, and the socio econimic conditions
 are also very poor.without the recognition of taliban led govt India and other countries can provide only limited help which will not be sufficient for the ppl of afg. 
also india's security is directly or indirectly dependent on afg, be it cross border terrorism, pak related issues etc. As of today, pak share a bitter relationship with afg so 
in fututre if anything happens bw india and pak, afg can be an asset. india also has cultral and religious significance in afg like bhairo
mandir and guru hari rai gurudwara, which can only be protected if india and taliban led afg govt cooperate for which recognitionis necessary.

but by looking from the perspective of human rights, stand of taliban is very controversial. be it ban on education of women, execution of lgbtq+, poor treatment of minorities taliban has disavowed its all promises.and it would be very wrong for india to plead/request un to give taliban led afg full recognition. It can malign India's image globally. so for the time being india should demand for de facto recognition by taking in point of the current taliban condition.",False
5,1,MANASVI KHANDELWAL,"""A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men.” - Gloria Steinem. 
Feminism according to Oxford dictionary means - the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes. Feminism, according to my understanding, gives a woman the right to do whatever she likes unless its illegal. It is about all genders having equal rights and opportunities. It’s about respecting diverse women’s experiences, identities, knowledge and strengths, and striving to empower all women to realize their full rights.
It’s about levelling the playing field between genders, and ensuring that diverse women and girls have the same opportunities in life available to boys and men. 
When they are by themselves, men can and will do the daily chores, but when they see a woman in the house, most men give up and expect a woman to take care of them.
It is still a common misconception that women should do the housework. Despite the fact that orientation fairness has been the subject of a ton of conversation, there are as yet numerous social orders wherein ladies are not treated similarly in the home.
Seven out of ten women surveyed by Toluna's third party found that their partners initially assisted with household chores during the lockdown but eventually stopped doing so.
However, the disparity manifests itself in numerous minor but significant indicators that go beyond the distribution of responsibilities. 77% of the ladies accepted they needed to change their timetables to oblige their spouses' exercises. A more pressing issue arises as a result of this scenario: To accommodate their husbands' schedules, why must only women make time sacrifices? Isn't their time equally valuable?
When they live with other men or with roommates, men will help with housework. If they lived with their flatmates rather than with their partners, they would have to do more housework.
Despite the fact that there is no rule stating that only women should perform household chores, this has been the practice for decades. Women believe that men do not consider them to be equal when it comes to family responsibilities.
It's time to ask about men's roles in household chores and question these outmoded norms. To be the change we want to see in the world, men must first take steps to ensure that the women in their lives and homes do not constantly feel overworked.
By delegating their duties and responsibilities to each other equally, men can show that they truly view their partners as equals. Again, gender is not a requirement for chores; rather, it is a sense of ownership and responsibility.
Sincerely, I believe that this is a ploy in our society's efforts to keep women engaged and satisfied with household chores. If the woman herself chooses to engage in the aforementioned domestic activities over other pursuits, then this is only right and empowering.



","When they have to deal with illegal immigrants who have been caught with drugs, the southwestern states that share a border with Mexico—Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California—are put under a lot of stress. Instead of being deported, illegal immigrants who are arrested for drug smuggling are processed by the local criminal justice system. They are also rarely transferred to the federal justice system because most of them are found with quantities of illegal drugs that are below the official limit for federal involvement. Any medical care, burials, or autopsies that the illegal immigrant requires while in custody must be paid for with local tax money. As a result, border states face increasing financial pressure to support the influx of illegal immigrants who require criminal justice processing. Two research questions were examined in this study: ( 1) What are the financial costs of providing law enforcement, criminal justice, and emergency medical services to illegal immigrants? 2) How does this affect the workload of each county department in the border states? Between February and December of 2000, site visits were carried out in each county. Key stakeholders were interviewed, and documents regarding county budgets, the U.S. Census, border crossing data from the INS, Border Patrol apprehension data from the Border Patrol, newspaper accounts, public documents, and public testimony in congressional hearings were analyzed. According to the findings, border counties incurred a total cost of approximately $108.2 million in fiscal year 1999. Over 50% of the total cost was borne by the two California counties. However, the smallest and poorest counties incurred the greatest financial burden when measured per capita. In 1999, criminal illegal immigrants received more than half of New Mexico's public safety budget. In fiscal year 1999, emergency medical services cost the 24 counties $19.1 million. Legislators should be able to use the findings to create legislation that would shift the burden of paying for illegal immigrants who commit crimes from local governments to the federal government.",False
5,1,Devesh Wadhwa,"I want to express my views for the motion , I think yes feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering because if we say empowerment , it is just not only making womens educated or providing them literacy . It can be done through various mediums . These vocational courses should be taken into consideration when we are saying empowerment . Like If any women is good in cooking she can pursue her forte and can represent her cooking skills at different national and international levels , which might bring laurels to nation itself and this will be termed as empowerment . And if they need any financial assistance , there are many NGO's too which are providing funds and classes for vocational courses. If we see rural areas , they might not be developed but they are having a good level of skills and talent. They are not having much opportunities to work upon their skills . Feminists should collectively work on providing them facilities, funding, opportunities and guidance. I think a large group of society don't knows that they are having a good set of skills which can bring laurels to themselves. So there should be a proper mentorship program organized by feminists for encouraging and motivating womens to actually come out of there houses and use there skills to represent this nation.  ","Definitely no , UN should not recognize Islamic Emirate of Taliban. Taliban is a group of terrorists and UN can't support it.

5,1,Arnav,"Why do we assume it a harmful thing to have a domestic partner/parent in the family? Haven't we proven that the moral structures of our homes  have fallen dramatically in the last two generations? Isn't this due to the departure of the ""housewife""? Sad how many of us couldn't sew a shirt or dress for the lives of us. And tragic how many families resort to 'grazing' instead of sit-down family meals, Meal time is a nurturing factor that makes households actual homes, yet this too has pretty well gone by the wayside with fewer and fewer actually knowing how to cook. And why does the domestically inclined need to be the women?
I don't know if I agree about falling moral structures of the family, but I do agree that the domestically inclined person in the family does not need to be the woman. In fact, I strongly believe that if we're going to be reclaiming dometicity and housework as an environmental and moral good, it needs to be done by both men and women. All such of these domestic activities no doubt shouldn't be considered de-meaning or low but the fact to be portrayed here is about equality which lies in proper share of workload hence I say these household activities not end up empowering women but stereotypes them into  b the only ones doing them hence I'd stand against.
Rest my case","The southwestern States that share a border with Mexico–Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California -- are put under strain when they must process illegal immigrants caught with illegal drugs. Illegal immigrants arrested for drug smuggling are not deported, rather they are processed through the local criminal justice system. They are also rarely transferred to the Federal justice system because most are caught with amounts of illegal drugs. Between January and August, Mexico registered 1,232 people-smuggling crimes, a jump of nearly 228% from the 376 logged during the same period.Government officials say many migrants pay people-smugglers to make their way on the perilous journey from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala up to the United States.
 To avoid the occurrence of  smuggling: In known drug smuggling areas, members should consider hiring additional security watchmen and arranging an underwater hull inspection before departure. 
 Awareness against the use and possession of drugs  is necessary among crewmembers. Crew should be briefed in advance of  any such co-operation with the drug traffickers/smugglers may not only violate company policy but also result in severe consequences by local authorities.It is recommended to install physical barriers to prevent any unauthorised access in hiding  spaces.

5,1,mayank singhal,"All work should be graded equally , whether It is going out and earning some bucks for living or It is doing domestic chores like gardening and cooking. As for smooth going of life , both earning and doing domestic chores are important .So yes , feminists can actively reclaim domestic activity as empowering. But according to me ,  there is nothing to compare or claiming empower as if a one is going out to earn and other is handling household chores then both are equal as well as  necessary , No matter whether the earning one is girl or boy and one who is handling domestic chores is boy or girl. So ,in my opinion the concept of feminism or Masculism arises due to thinking of male society as well as female society also. The thinking of masculines that household work requires no effort and they are only pillar of their family and also , The female's ideology of thinking their household work is incomparable and a women is one who make efforts towards family.  But the reality is men and women both are strong pillar of society and family as well as family is run by combined efforts of both men and women. But the main problem that give rise to this concept is that society always idolize women to do household work and men to earn for living of their family But there is no problem if a women does work to earn and men does household work. so feminist and masculine fight to break this stereotype . and thus feminist actively reclaim domestic activities are hard and also symbol of empower.

5,1,Sarthak Dewan,"For the motion
It is not accurate to say that feminists do not view activities like cooking or gardening as empowering. Many feminists believe that all work, including traditional ""women's work,"" can be empowering if it is done freely and by choice. Some feminists may argue that certain activities, such as cooking and gardening, have traditionally been assigned to women as a means of oppression and that these activities have been undervalued as a result. These feminists may see cooking and gardening as just one of many activities that people can choose to engage in, and they may not view these activities as inherently feminist or anti-feminist.

However, it is important to recognize that feminism is a broad and diverse movement, and different feminists may have different viewpoints on this issue. Some feminists may view cooking and gardening as empowering activities because they involve creativity, skill, and self-sufficiency. These activities can also provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Other feminists may view these activities as traditional ""women's work"" that has been undervalued and underappreciated due to societal gender roles and expectations. These feminists may argue that the fact that these activities have traditionally been assigned to women as a means of oppression and that they have been seen as less important or valuable than work traditionally assigned to men.

Ultimately, the question of whether cooking or gardening is empowering or not depends on the context in which these activities are being performed and the individual person's feelings about them. Some people may find great empowerment and satisfaction in these activities, while others may not. The important thing is that individuals have the freedom to choose which activities they engage in and that they are not limited by societal gender roles or expectations.","Immigration policy at the US-Mexico border is a complex and controversial issue. The United States has historically had a large number of immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries, and the issue of how to handle the flow of people across the border has been a contentious one.

The rise in illegal immigration has also put a strain on the resources of the US border patrol and immigration system. It has led to overcrowding in detention facilities and a backlog in the processing of asylum claims and other applications for legal status. This has caused concern among human rights groups and has led to criticism of the US government's handling of the situation.

In addition to the impact on the United States and Mexico, the situation at the border also has broader implications for international relations and the global economy. The United States is a major destination for immigrants from Latin America and other regions, and the issue of immigration has the potential to affect relations with these countries.

There are several possible solutions to this problem. One approach is to increase funding for border security measures, such as building a wall or increasing the number of border patrol agents. This can help to deter illegal immigration and reduce the level of illegal activity at the border. However, it is important to recognize that border security measures alone are not a comprehensive solution.

Another approach is to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty and violence in the countries where immigrants are coming from. This could involve providing economic assistance and addressing issues such as corruption and political instability. By addressing the underlying issues that drive people to leave their home countries, it may be possible to reduce the number of immigrants attempting to enter the United States illegally.

It is also important to consider the human rights of immigrants and ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect. This could involve increasing the capacity of the immigration system to process asylum claims and other applications for legal status in a timely and fair manner. It could also involve providing access to legal representation and other support for immigrants during the immigration process.

Ultimately, addressing the issue of immigration at the US-Mexico border will require a combination of efforts, including increased border security measures, addressing the root causes of immigration, and respecting the rights of immigrants. It is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address effectively.

5,1,Kirti ,"Feminists should definitely reclaim domestic activities(such as gardening, cooking, etc.) as empowering because domestic activities because honestly, why shouldn't they? Patriarchal society only was what considered these chores as something ""lowly"" and meant for females only.  The 9-5 jobs require skills; well so do domestic chores! Cooking is not everyone's cup of tea and chores like gardening requires some pre-requisite knowledge and skills that can't be truly attained by everyone. It is so insane that just because no one is getting  paid for doing domestic activities, it is not given much recognition and appreciation but when someone is getting is getting paid for these ""domestic activities"", they are getting fame, money, recognition and everything in between. 
All types of activities are relevant. Just because they are not paying does not mean they shouldn't be empowering at all. Feminists are basically advocates of ALL women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes,  right? It doesn't mean they should only promote working women; they should also empower female homemakers and empower what they do. Just because they aren't earning doesn't my any means imply they aren't doing anything to contribute to their family/society or aren't significant enough. Empowering domestic chores will also help men out there in the world who want to perform domestic chores without feeling embarrassed and being ridiculed by people. So if someone wants to willingly perform domestic activities, feminists should support him or her wholeheartedly because these activities are equally important and valuable as others are. ","From what I know about the perilous situation of the US-Mexico border, I think that the immigrants who are stuck should be sent back to their countries but USA shouldn't spend its funds on their return because practically and brutally speaking, most of the migrants came illegally so USA government shouldn't really be held responsible for their upkeep. But from humanitarian point of view, it's literally horrendous the way they are being treated because they crossed the border only in search of work, better opportunities, etc. but they are being treated as if they are animals with no human rights. Donald Trump's many decisions regarding this situation like increasing in border personnel; sending thousands of active-duty troops to the border; threatening Mexico with tariffs if it did not increase its own border enforcement; ratcheting up previous administrations’ deterrence efforts; instituting a ban on immigration and travel from several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Somalia, and Yemen and last but not the least: Title 42 make me feel he was like Hitler: cold ruthless nationalist. So his actions were actually beneficial(in very loose terms though) for his country but not for others. Speaking of the rise of illegal activities and it's impact on both the countries, over 2 million people entered USA illegally this year. Under the provision of Title 42, 1.6 million people have been denied entry. However, this has not done much to prevent illegal crossings as data suggests the crossings this year were the highest in years. And this has obviously not been all well and good for Mexico too( I don't know much about Mexico though :( ) Smuggling has also become prevalent near the border. In simple words I would say that it's a complicated problem where it's unlikely that both parties get equally benefited but one of the solutions I can offer is that an independent committee should be made where 50% representatives are from USA and another 50 has representatives from countries which have migrants coming from their country to USA, where number of representatives will be proportional to the ratio of migrants in USA from their respective countries. They should come up with innovative strategies to solve this dilemma. And the stock immigrants should make a committee which talks to the USA officials and they together reach to a solution which will be beneficial for both of them (it might not be totally fair because USA will be USA, but it'll be better than nothing).",False

No work is big or small , all tasks hold their own importance and should be seen as such. So it is my firm belief that we should see all work as empowering and not just high paying or higher decision making positions as such. Feminists tend to forget that household work is also a crucial part of life. Feminists have been trying to portray men as “EVIL” vile beings who enjoyed freedoms that women don’t but it is a bit biased thing to say. People have started to misjudge these activities as something that will be done regardless and hence their value has degraded. On the contrary i suggest that these tasks are very important and should be considered as such in turn seen as empowering. But realistically it is not only the fault of feminists, the broader view of a society should change in order to see these dreams turn into reality. People as a whole shape the mindset which is then carried forward in the form of opinions which in turn shape how feminists react to the population. These fallacies will definitely take time to vanish completely but that does not mean we should stop trying.

5,1,Sakshi,"Speaking for the motion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering I'd say noone can make u feel inferior without ur consent especially based on ur choice of work and thats how it should be , we must understand that managing the domestic front n taking care of a household is as empowering as being the ceo of an MNC. Isnt it impossible to imagine our day to day lives without our mothers being our forever saviours and a megaforce at handling our daily blunders at home, from a few yrs females n also a proportion of the males of 21st century believe that in order to be modern n  to be the superior in the ever changing society we need to be financially independent n be an extraordinary force in our respective careers which is sort of true but a little aspect of independency n empowerment Is often neglected which is being able to perform domestic activities with efficiency . Be it a boy or girl he or she should atleast be capable of managing their own chores however due to availability of house helps n workers we don't mark this as necessary but if COVID times hv taught us anything it is the fact that u NVR know what might fall upon u in the near future n u hv to be prepared to tackle the adverse situations be it an year in quarantine or having to do house chores due to unavailability of help . It's often said that the new age girls need to be independent financially and i completely agree with this thought however I strongly affirm that there's nothing wrong or self deprecatory in being a housewife or taking charge of ur own house chores , it's completely a matter of choice .We as a society need to reshape our perception of how we view ourselves, women who willingly manage their homes and even househelps. Empowerment and feminism donot only stand for giving a woman or a person opportunities at their workplace it also affirms that one must fight against all prejudices and preset social norms that pose a threat to social, economic n political equality for all genders. I as a woman should hv the right to decide my own path and ""the right to choose is empowering"". After all the world just doesn't run with concrete jungles n corporate universe it's our very nature that a human being needs a home and thus a homemaker. That's what makes me feel that there's an imperative need to regard domestic activities as empowering. ","Given the current scenario of annexation of Afghanistan by Taliban, which also refers itself by its state name "" The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" , I affirm that UN should not recognise the Taliban government not just because of the eminent scope of history repeating itself but also because  the Taliban threaten Afghans’ civil and political rights enshrined in the constitution created by the U.S.-backed government. Since regaining control, the Taliban have taken actions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the late 1990s before their ouster by the U.S. troops in 2001 and the UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations. We as a civilisation have moved from the era of Hitler, Nero and homicidal Genghis Khan there should not be any setback that forces us to accept the rule of an ultraconservative group like Taliban in any part of the world that might lead to another civil war. Moreover every citizen must have a say in the type of people they want to see in their government, in 2019 a survey conducted by the Asia Foundation a U.S. based N.G.O. found out that only 13.4 percent of Afghans had sympathy for the Taliban. As intra-Afghan peace talks stalled in early 2021, an overwhelming majority surveyed said it was important to protect women’s rights, freedom of speech, and the constitution. How can an organisation which doesn't even consider females as equal n independent race be allowed to run a country thats what the facts state. Women have seen their rights  being obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working. Amnesty International reports a drastic increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male chaperone and to completely cover their bodies. The rates of child marriage have also increased , the growing unemployment and poverty rates along with detoriating health care facilities have led to poor standards of living . Along with posing severe threats on the domestic front Taliban also emerges as an evil on the international front ,moreover, international observers remain concerned that the Taliban support terrorist organizations, particularly al-Qaeda, posing a threat to regional and international security. The United States invaded Afghanistan after it refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Under the Taliban’s rule, Afghanistan could become a safe haven for terrorists capable of launching attacks against the United States and its allies. Many Western countries, including the United States, shut down their diplomatic offices in Afghanistan after the Taliban took over. They have refused to recognize and establish diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, which calls the country the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. (A handful of states, including China and Russia, have accredited Taliban-selected diplomats.) ,this is what makes it convincing to oppose the taliban and raise our voices for Afghan civilians rather than recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

5,1,Kavya Shakya,"Stance: For the motion.
Firstly, I don't really expect a lot from the so called elite club of hypocrites/feminists other than benefitting themselves, in the name of representing a literal half of the humankind. 
But assuming their representation to be true and fair, I would say, yes....they should definitely reclaim equality in activities including domestic activities, instead of portraying their representation in them as a matter of backwardness or something pitiful. Every work, whether paid or unpaid is valuable in itself. Comparison of work, is as idiotic as comparison of air and water, in terms of life importance. Feminists should not only reclaim, but also urge/motivate men to do the same. Men and women are meant to be together with love, care and mutual respect. Infact, their bond is considered to be eternal in Hinduism. The mutual respect part can only be achieved by equal division of every kind of work between the two. I believe, that if either side starts considering domestic chores to be menial or petty jobs, these basic yet important tasks will remain undone, leading to an instability at the root level. 
It's certainly not a good practice, but it's and unsaid rule, that the rural India follows the path of the urban counterpart. Hence, it's very important for urban women to set a good pathway and example for them. What we see nowadays, is that women want a part in high-paid low risk jobs in the name of equal representation and social justice, which definitely is injustice to other males. This is as unjust as not asking for representation in labour, yet asking for a part in the benefits, it harvests. Reservation in educational institutions is okay, but in professional arena, it's unfair. If women really want a part in the benefits of what men enjoy, they should certainly ask for the painful responsibilities too. Equality is of no benefit if it encroaches the rights of the other side, true equality requires fruitful dialogue and understanding from both the sides.
So, there is nothing like that women should be limited to these chores, it's more like they should not feel any less in reclaiming these tasks.
In the end, I would like to state, that feminists should NOT ONLY reclaim their representation in domestic chores as empowerment, but also encourage men to partner in them. ","In the light of recent political turmoil and shift of power in Afghanistan from a democratic govt. to the Taliban militant regime, which is infamous for its islamic extremism....there is one thing to be relieved of, that it didn't really see much of bloodshed. 
As far as the US is concerned, it was more of a poorly performed staged act of takeover. It appeared like a power transfer and pointed major holes in the Afghani governance and military, trained/supervised by the US. 
The UN is a big platform, providing a dialogue means for the nations across the globe. Hence, keeping in mind, the geopolitical might af the UN, it SHOULD recognise the new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, on the basis of some CONDITIONS. The current regime is already known for its unwelcoming attitude towards foreign nationals, foreign opinion and women rights. It can't and shouldn't be forgotten what they did to the sisters of Afghanistan, in the name of religious fanaticism. The recent unreasonable restrictions on women education over there is the recent example that the regime is not going to change its ways that easily. At the time of recent takeover, the rules were pretty acceptable, yet having hijab as a compulsory attire at workplaces. This indicates that the new govt was just enacting liberal attitude until it was in a limelight, to get foreign/UN recognition. 
Even if we keep aside the topic of human rights and women empowerment, the Taliban is well known to terror outsourcing. Encouragement of such a power, is more like unleashing terror and chaos on not only to its immediate neighbours, but to entire globe. The attitude of the new Afghan Government shall be of a mutual benefit by the means of trade and debate, and not of strict religious boundaries. Agree or not, Taliban IS a great potentiometer threat to India as well. It's functioning is something to be kept an eye on. 
Another part of the problems stack, is the lack of any real experience and expertise of running an entire nation, taking care of its citizens. The state is already performing worse economically, and remains backward due to its political and military conflicts over decades. Also, the Taliban is known to smuggle narcotics, grown in Afghanistan to make money, and several other illegal methods. Such a regime reminds me of North Korea.....which we certainly can't have right in our yard, cuz it's unruly and monstrous in the end.
Long story short, if Taliban wants recognition, it needs to earn that. It needs to develop an attitude of negotiations and not powerplay at gunpoint and force, before preparing itself to be on the table. Furthermore, a major population of Afghanistan is now unsupportive of foreign interference, ever since the US left....so there isn't what we have much in the court, except keeping reigns tight on the diplomacy part. Lastly, we can just hope for the best.",False

Many of these individuals are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries and seeking a better life in the US. However, they face significant barriers to entry, including stringent immigration policies and a lack of legal channels for migration. As a result, many immigrants are forced to turn to illegal activities, such as crossing border without documentation or paying smugglers to transport them.

The rise of illegal immigrants has had a significant impact on both the United States and Mexico. In the United States, illegal immigration has been used as a political issue to stir up fear and anger among population. This has led to policies that are harsh and punitive towards immigrants, including the separation of families and the detention of asylum seekers. In Mexico, the increase in illegal immigrants has strained the county’s resources and led to increased violence and corruption. 

There are several possible solutions to this problem. One solution is to increase the number of legal channels of immigration, such as work visas and family reunification programs. This would allow immigrants to enter the country legally and avoid the dangers of illegal crossings. Another solution is to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty and violence in the home countries. This could be done through foreign aid programs and other forms of assistance. Finally, there needs to be a more humane and compassionate approach to immigration policy , one that recognises the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

Even when women try to enter the workforce, unpaid domestic labour becomes a major obstacle in their access to paid work opportunities. Although women’s inclusion into the workforce is considered to be a sign of empowerment, it leaves them with a double burden. They have to handle work responsibilities in addition to their unpaid domestic work. When one woman steps out of the house to work, the responsibility of domestic work falls on the other women in the house. In nuclear families where both the partners work outside, women are still responsible for almost all house and family-related work. Research shows that women spend more than twice the time on domestic work than men, which means that women work for more time on a daily basis than men.","The Taliban have claimed that because it has the control of “all borders, territory and major cities of Afghanistan,” and has formed “the government of people,” the group deserves an international recognition and Afghanistan’s seat in the U.N. The problem with this argument is two-fold: first, the effective control doctrine is neither sufficient nor even the principal condition for recognition or obtaining a seat in the U.N. Traditionally, international recognition requires meeting four conditions by a new government: (1) effective control; (2) popular support and domestic legitimacy; (3) permanency and stability; and (4) ability and willingness to fulfill international obligations. Secondly, the Taliban fall way short of internal legitimacy by any metric. International law and practice have increasingly emphasized legitimacy of governments whether through elections, referendums, or some sort of public engagement. For instance, in 2013 when the Egyptian defense minister declared the end of the Mohamed Morsi government, the international community conditioned their recognition of any new government on holding immediate parliamentary elections.

46,0,PramodKumar,"Women Empowerment today, has become the most discussed topic around the world. In basic terms, it means to diminish the gender gap and providing equal opportunities and rights to men and women.

In India, women have always been subjected to acts of physical violence and mental tortures since centuries. They are raped, physically assaulted, subjected to mental harassment,  killed for dowry, experience workplace discrimination, paid less than men for the same job, not send to school, etc. This suppression of women in all the spheres of life is a major hindrance to the progress of the nation.
Most of the work done by women in India is unpaid and is in the unorganized sector. Women in India constitute 49% of the agriculture workforce though they hold even less than 2% of the land. Almost half of the women in rural India don’t have a bank account in their own name and a few of them have a valuable asset in their name.

The society, as well as other government and private organizations, must come forward to empower women.","The government of Afghanistan, officially called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is the central government of Afghanistan, a unitary state. Under the leadership of the Taliban, the government is a theocracy and an emirate with political power concentrated in the hands of a supreme leader and his clerical advisors, collectively referred to as the Leadership. The Leadership makes all major policy decisions behind closed doors, which are then implemented by the country's civil service and judiciary. As Afghanistan is an Islamic state, governance is based on Sharia, which the Taliban enforces strictly through extensive social and cultural policy.

Over its history, Afghanistan has variously been governed as a monarchy, a republic, and a theocracy. The current theocratic government came to power in 2021 with the Taliban's victory in a twenty-year insurgency against the western-backed Islamic Republic, after having itself been ousted in 2001.

The current government is internationally unrecognized and lacks a clear constitutional basis, though the Taliban has announced plans to form a constitutional commission in the near future. It claims to be using the 1964 monarchy constitution in the interim, amended to be compliant with Sharia law, but there is a lack of evidence that it is being followed. Instead, the government applies an arbitrary interpretation of Sharia. There is no separation of powers, with total authority vested in the Leadership.[1][2] The government is criticized by international observers for totalitarianism,[3] systemic human rights violations, as well as for being unaccountable, opaque, and exclusive of women, religious and ethnic minorities, and those with dissenting views.

As we all know Taliban imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law and also not able to give Afghans proper security, food and economic opportunities. UN recorded violation of various human rights in Afghanistan.

In my opinion the UN should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban and should intervene for the betterment of lives of people residing in Afghanistan.",False

As I have heard feminists don't want to do these things and just focus on their career which is good and all but not sufficient to live a self-sufficient life which is their true aim i.e. to be independent. Thus I think the domestic activities put Feminists in a much more empowering position rather than at a disadvantage.",I am completely against the recognition of the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. The Islamic Emirate of Taliban is not a people-chosen party and thus is not a representative of the people of Afghanistan. The philosophical and political views of this party are hostile and are against basic human rights and clear objections and negative approaches towards women in the country. The Islamic Emirate of Taliban is an authoritarian regime and thus is not in any significant way beneficial to society. The UN acts as a peace-representing body to the world and thus accepting the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban is against its purpose i.e. maintaining international peace and security. Therefore I am strongly against the plea to recognize the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban by the UN.,False
5,1,Arnav Khare,"Feminism started out as a movement to give women in western nations the right to enjoy basic freedoms like voting and employement so they could live an independent life of diginity. Nowadays gardening and cooking which are activities that everyone should know, be it a man or a woman or anybody in between, are seen as feminine and as something that's holding them back from being an independent woman. No, these are basic survival skills that everyone should learn. On top that, our generation and the generation before us has mostly seen, duty of being a mother and especially a stay at home mother as one the toughest jobs out there. Nonstop,without a break, 365 days a year you to manage an entire household, that's commendable and we are all grateful for that. Nobody asks their grandmothers what qualifications they have, how many degrees they hold, or much they earned, No, we just love for being themselves, for being strong women who could manage dozens of people, cook delicious food for them, which to this day makes everyone of us nostalgic. Sure, earning for the the family is important but learning basic skills such as cooking are just as important because they induce a sense of discipline and at the same time make you independent. What more empowering than having the ability to take care of yourself and others rather than outsourcing jobs that we see as domestic chores. So, I believe feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.","The UN unfortunately like any other organisation is today's era is corrupt. We found out how corrupt the WHO is during the pandemic, trying it's level best to defend China even though everyone could see who was at fault. UN is an organization controlled by the US and it's vassal states. Americans have believed that their ideals were the best and regularly tried to force it down the throats of every other nation, matter of fact, 89% of all the wars after 1945 have been started by America which have resulted in the loss of countless innocent lives, all in the name of democracy. That was the case till September 11, 2001, the day when the US found out that the world hates them, and with Taliban it was the same story. In the 1980s USSR invaded Afghanistan to increase their geopolitical influence because their rival, US was expanding it's influence in Pakistan. Afghanistan at that time was an urban nation and quite westernized as well. The Mujahideens began to fight back the soviets but in the process they found themselves killing each other using the weaponry that US supplied them through Pakistan. After the soviets retreated, pakistan redirected these fighters with the help of US into kashmir which as we all know caused the genocide and exodus of the 90s. The Indian government at that time being very weak couldn't do anything about it other than being bullied by the US through pakistan. The Afghani warlords then recruited fighters from Pakistani madrasa's hence the name taliban where ""talib"" means student, to fight for them.
It essentially was a brainchild of the ISI with help from the US to destabilize India and use afghans as a cannon for it. Afghans just like Indians are tired of being controlled and being bullied around by western powers and hence in the past decade have tried to reclaim their identity, So should the UN recognise taliban, doesn't really matter because it's a corrupt organization anyways that ignores the crimes of western nations and shames eastern nations at every step of the way.

While we all agree that women need to be empowered in this modern world which was once full of discrimination against them, I think that domestic activities are not the right sector to target because in India women are only allowed to work domestically if not for complete restrictions from working by family members. The notion in today's India is mostly that ""it is fine whatever women are doing but at home"" which is a lot better that staying shut all the time behind a veil but I believe we can do a lot better. We need to normalise the idea of women going out for work and earning the bread for the family because female employment is organised sector being so low is just sad. While the female being the bread winner of the family is being accepted little by little in the urban areas , the men in rural areas still laugh at such a culture all the while where the female is unable to raise their voice against them. If we want to empower women for real then we should Target the sectors which are stereotypically for men such as space, science, engineering, accounting, entrepreneurship, etc.
In conclusion I would like to say that increasing women employment in any sector will help women but we should be focusing more on those that will help bring impact on the society and it's mindset.","Recently Taliban took over the country of Afghanistan and changed the country's name to Islamic Emirate of Taliban.

The rise of illegal activities along the border is causing severe problems for both countries, and the immigrants who are caught in the middle of it.
Immigration policies in the US have become increasingly hostile, with many immigrants being denied entry or facing criminal charges. This has led to a significant increase in illegal crossings, as people desperately try to find a way to stay in the US. This has put both countries in a precarious situation, with the Mexican government facing an influx of immigrants, and the US government having to deal with the consequences of illegal immigration.
The only way to find a solution to the current crisis is to find a way to make the US-Mexico border more secure. This could be done through the implementation of stricter immigration policies and increased border security measures. Additionally, the US and Mexico should work together to develop a comprehensive immigration plan that would allow immigrants to enter the US legally.
Finally, both countries must focus on providing better economic opportunities for those living in the border region. This would help to reduce the incentives for illegal activities and help to alleviate the economic strain on both countries.

5,1,Shreya singh,"the Mariam Webster's dictionary defines a feminist as an advocate of women's rights based on the equality of sexes. And much of the existing debate about feminism can just be translated into how one would want to define this ''equality'', whether it is equality at the professional or domestic front? at the economic and social front?,or equality in everyday life and the heart and minds of people? does feminism mean women and men should have similar duties in every sphere of life? is it viable considering women and men have different mental and physical strengths and capabilities?
the root of the feminist moment was cultural inequalities widespread in patriarchal societies in the early 19 th century. there was a widespread acceptance of an image of proper roles and spheres for women and men. women were expected to do household chores and look after children and men were to occupy the public sphere (earning wages and taking part in politics).. This was in no way justified as women and men are intellectually equal, fed with the everyday misery and frustration feminists declared intellectual equality between men and women and asked for better education, equal pay, and similar working conditions. the possibility that women could have similar if not better professional life than men was at the heart of 19 th century moments, and women started moving out of their homes to earn wages ,disregarding their domestic duties, and families started falling out. Men still refused to take part in domestic duties because it was ""women's work"" and because women were seen as lesser than men their work was less important. Because of this even after having equality in professional life , there is no real equality on the domestic front. Many women in the world have to balance both their domestic duties and professional lives as many men still refuse to help out. Women need to emphasize that domestic work is just as important and empowering as a professional career,,and push for a 50/50 split between both the genders.
Looking at it from another perspective, today feminism demands that women could only find fulfillment through a career outside the home .Women are conditioned to feel guilty about staying at home and desiring to be wives and mothers and stay-at-home mother is viewed as a kind of second class women. The fight of women's rights has actually turned out to be fight against family.We need to change this derogatory view by glorifying women's role in life.Giving birth is the greatest power one can have, Motherhood is the most beautiful possibility on earth and needs to be glorified in order to fix widespread familial problems in society.Women need to be proud mothers and caregivers in addition to having successful careers . This cannot be done without support from men.Real equality starts at home and world needs to push for change","The Taliban took control by force in 2021 in Afghanistan after the United States withdrew its troops as outlined in a peace agreement with the Taliban. the Taliban has campaigned aggressively for international recognition since the takeover.Several countries have vowed to never recognise the Islamic emirate. the Taliban want international legal status of being a state, having the legal capacity to act on behalf of the people and have authority as a government within territorial boundaries.

People live under pathetic conditions .They have killed several people on grounds of belonging to different religion.They have turned the whole of the territory into a ghetto of misery and suffering.
Challenges to the Taliban’s power in Afghanistan have not all been internal. In late September, the Taliban announced the formation of an all-male cabinet, made up of prominent Taliban figures, some of whom are designated as terrorists by the United Nations and appear on U.N. and U.S. sanctions lists. The Taliban government is unstable from its very first days.Such a government should never be recognised by other countries . Engagement with Taliban in terms of business interests and others, will have to be limited.The takeover of government led to disruption of international finances, has left afghanistan into economic crisis.The UN general assembly adopted a resolution that sends a strong message to Taliban that world body will not recognise Afghanistan's authorities without respect for human rights ,including for women , girls and minorities.There remains serious concern for women and girls ,the restrictions imposed on their participation in public life, education will be a serious violation of human rights.Thousands of women have since lost their jobs or were forced to resign from government institutions and the private sector.
Girls have been prevented from attending middle and high school. Many women have demanded their rights be reinstated by taking to the streets, protesting, and organizing campaigns.

Women have always been indulged in domestic activity since the very beginning of human development. They are treated like domesticated animals who are just meant to do a work and they are taken for granted and said like what's new or hard in this. Men don't acknowledge the role of women in their life untill they do the same work that women do daily. Doing domestic activity is not called empowerment. Empowerment is doing something that men do so that everyone can understand they are also capable of doing everything that men can do. Going outside and doing jobs, handling teams, institutions and sometimes nations is called actually empowerment of women. Where they feel that,""yes i have achieved something"". And gardening, cooking, doing dishes and clothes is not empowerment or something that men do care about them, or which gave them feeling of them being strong to handle things themselves. Women are still kept away from school and university in some regions so that they can do household work by not their own decision they are still supposed to think like that they are made for these works but if you think that household activity can empower women then I think you are absolutely wrong.","I think it's quite unjustified manner to took over a country where a dumb nation called American leaves their high tech weapons and fleds from Afghanistan leaving a group of terrorists to hold a country who are not even capable of handling it.

5,1,Bihaan Chakraborty,"To start the discussion I feel like we need to understand the idea behind feminism or in general understand what feminist is. A feminist is someone who believes in feminism , feminism is not an idea but actually more of a movement , quite simply feminism is all about  genders having equal rights while respecting women when it comes to whatever they choose to pursue or follow in life. To be put into perspective , a woman should be able to do whatever a man is able to achieve in life , and no one has a say regarding the matter at hand. Feminism plays a great hand when it comes casual sexism , sexual exploitation or any kind of sexual domination in our day to day lives.
In households world wide , the women cook , clean , nurture for the sake of the family , in most of the cases this effort is overlooked , this effort is considered as your average task in day to day life but it is due to the diligence of a woman the family is able to function as a whole. In short these activities are important , more so a necessity but is overlooked as a second tier duty as usual as the men who provide for the family and are able to earn a living is considered to be the primary goal in most cases. Lets talk about how domestic activities are co related with empowerment in society. Empowerment refers to women having established complete control on their lives and actions , they have the right to make their own decisions in any filed and should not have to be discriminated for it. Empowerment means that people are equal citizens. When it comes being equal in a society setting ,it means being equal in social , economic and domestic spheres of life but we overlook the domestic factor as well. Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering . Domestic activities dictate the power struggle within a household , but can it contribute to feminism? 
Both women and men primed to feel relatively poor are more likely to support find that girls building their human capital and women engaging in domestic ventures which means that  the salience of inequality can prompt support for women’s economic participation. Support is not necessarily accompanied by increases in support for women having increased decision-making authority in their respective households. Women are more likely to express support for women’s participation in intra-household decision-making, the prime does not similarly alter men’s stated preferences regarding women’s participation in decision-making. ","To understand the gravity of the situation , we must understand what exactly the Taliban is and what it exactly stands for. The Taliban is the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan , more so of a militant movement or power in this particular country. When it comes to the working of this emirate it includes resurgence , terrorist activity , coalition invasion , targeted killings , a resurgence , diplomatic negotiations , deals with the USA and imposing Islamic beliefs on the world. As of most recently , the Taliban overthrew the existing government in 2021 and imposed itself as the main authority in the country , this was due to all the military power the Taliban had backing itself. Th Taliban are also notorious when it comes subjugation against women , regarding education , marriage and their freedom in general. Following the Taliban's rise to power, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan's model of governance has been widely criticized by the international community, despite the government's repeated calls for international recognition and engagement. So this begs the question , should the UN approve it as a legit government body?
When it comes to the Taliban we know that this body makes all decisions that require some sort of military power , but as of the recent rise to power the government of Afghanistan  had lost all its ability to provide for its people , unlike the previous era where the government still could exercise its laws , the deterioration of the Afghan economy, and rising crime, are not yet at such levels as to signify the disintegration of Taliban authority, although it is still early days. All these factors may lead us to to believe that the Taliban authority may be fit to lead the country as it is. But the actual matter being that the people of this country  have lost their sense of freedom which leaves now growth of the country. It cannot be a successful cause with the people of its own country going against its country , its more of dictatorship than a government. As an unapproved government, the Taliban is treated as a state organ for the purpose of the law of state responsibility. Thus, its government is responsible for any breaches of Afghanistan’s obligations, and has a duty to cease violations and make reparation. As a successful insurgency, it is additionally responsible for its own past violations as an insurgent group, that is, before it became the government. Unless the people of the country are able to live peacefully & arent hesitant to grasp oppurtunites or exercise theirs rights without taking the government into consideration , the UN should not approve of this body.",False

Feminism is one of the most significant movements in the world today. It has been around for centuries, but it is only in the last few decades that it has become a mainstream political and social phenomenon.

Feminism is not just about women’s rights – it also addresses issues such as gender equality and economic equality. It also affects men, who are often excluded from these discussions due to gender stereotypes.

The feminist movement has been a key component of the history of the modern world. It was one of the major social movements that led to the end of gender inequality and ended centuries-long oppression and discrimination against women.

The term “feminism” has been used for different things in different contexts, but it is most commonly associated with a political philosophy that advocates women’s rights and equality.

5,1,Daksh Baweja,"While it is important for feminists to challenge and subvert oppressive systems and structures, actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering is not the most effective way to do so. The expectation that women should engage in domestic activities is itself a product of oppressive gender roles, and trying to reclaim these activities reinforces rather than challenges these harmful roles.

Rather than trying to reclaim domestic activities as empowering, feminists should work to dismantle the systems that assign value to certain activities based on gender. This means pushing for more equitable distribution of domestic and paid work, and challenging the belief that certain activities are inherently more valuable or important based on gender.

By focusing on the empowerment of domestic activities, feminists risk falling into the trap of individualism and overlooking the larger systems and structures that perpetuate gender inequality. Relying on the empowerment of domestic activities also fails to address the root of the problem, which is the societal devaluation and dismissal of this work.

Furthermore, valuing domestic activities as empowering reinforces the harmful stereotype that women are naturally suited for domestic work and men are naturally suited for work outside the home. This stereotype is not only harmful to women, but it also limits the choices and opportunities of men. By challenging and subverting these harmful gender roles, feminists can work towards a more equal and just society where all individuals are free to pursue their passions and interests without being constrained by societal expectations.

Overall, while it is important for feminists to challenge and subvert oppressive gender roles, actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering is not the most effective way to do so. Instead, feminists should work towards a society where all individuals can pursue their passions and interests without being constrained by harmful gender roles and expectations. "," UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. The United Nations (UN) may choose not to recognize a government or state for various reasons. One reason could be if the government or state in question is not considered to be legitimate by the international community. This could be due to the government or state being established through illegal means, such as the use of force or coercion, or if the government or state is not representative of the will of the people.

Additionally, the UN may choose not to recognize a government or state if it is deemed to be in violation of international law or the principles and values upheld by the UN. For example, if a government or state is found to be committing human rights abuses or engaging in actions that pose a threat to international peace and security, the UN may decide not to recognize it.

The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, twenty years after their ouster by U.S. troops. Only three countries—Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—ever recognized the Taliban as the country's lawful government and, despite repeated efforts, it never gained control of Afghanistan's UN seat.

The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities. They have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down. Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared. 

Moreover, Taliban support terrorist organizations, particularly al-Qaeda, posing a threat to regional and international security. Under the Taliban’s rule, Afghanistan could become a safe haven for terrorists capable of launching attacks against other countries.

If UN recognizes them without any terms and conditions, then it will be like accepting them and their actions. The United States could engage in extended negotiations with the Taliban over recognition, subject to the Taliban meeting certain conditions as the United States and its allies try to use recognition as a carrot to urge the Taliban to undertake certain fundamental reforms.

In this blasphemy the ones who were shunned the most were the women, the ones who did one of the most crucial tasks, to hold together and build it from the ground up and support it once it's standing. I completely agree with the fact that the women of our world have been held down and oppressed but the feminist movement is deviating from its foundational ideals to a group of rather opportunistic and privileged women. We shouldn't leave domestic work behind calling it unempowering and pick other ""empowering"" work on the contrary we should change the thought that domestic is unempowering or demeaning so to speak.

There are several reasons why feminists should reclaim domestic activities as empowering.

UN are known for their secondary name termed as peacekeepers who failed at very first level to resolve the conflict between Russian and USA(itself) in the lands of Afghanistan which caused all of this mess and later on they had done nothing for the betterment of Afghan..
UN should never even consider recognition of Taliban as it could give terrorist a formal representation which will help them to get more powerful and will expand exponentially and will lead to disaster to other nations as well as to the whole man kind.
Despite of all of this, the UN can bring up USA , Russia and other capable countries to involve in this situation jointly as a team and work together to kick off the Taliban aka the dictatorship of violent rageful terrorist organization to save the innocents of afghan from persecution and mal-practice by Sharia Law which includes-
Prohibition of Women entrance in public place such as park and not allowing females to get educated from schools and colleges
Ban on multi-form of music as they seemed to be un-islamic - Afghan folk singer Fawad Andarabi was dragged from his home and killed…. This can explain it well about how inhuman they are.
Implementation of violent punishments, such as public executions, stoning, floggings and amputations.
And further deterioration of human rights….

5,1,Gaurang Santoria,"There is a widespread cultural belief that housework, such as gardening, cooking, and housekeeping, is ""women's work"" and is, as a result, of lower value and importance than traditionally male occupations like paid work outside the home. The gender pay gap and the undervaluation of women's contributions and labour can both be exacerbated by this negative stereotype. Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, according to some feminists, can help challenge and dismantle these harmful stereotypes and the oppressive systems they reinforce. Feminists can fight the idea that domestic labour is less important or valuable than other types of work by valuing and celebrating it. They can also work to create a more equitable society in which all types of labour are respected and valued. This may entail making a conscious decision to engage in domestic activities and advocating for societal changes and policies that recognize and support the value of domestic work.","It is inappropriate for me to suggest whether the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban should be recognized by the United Nations. The choice to perceive an administration or state is a complex and nuanced policy-centred issue that requires cautious thought of a scope of variables, including the perspectives and encounters of individuals impacted by the public authority, the nation's set of experiences and current political circumstances, and worldwide regulations and standards.

It is essential to keep in mind that the Taliban are a militant group that has been involved in Afghan conflicts and violations of human rights. The group has been criticized for its treatment of women and girls, including its strict interpretation of Islamic law and restrictions on women's rights and freedoms, and it has been designated as a terrorist organization by some governments and international organizations.

In the end, the decision to recognize the Taliban or any other government ought to be based on an in-depth assessment of the situation on the ground and the possible outcomes of recognition. The United Nations and other international actors must take into account how their actions will affect the Afghan people and work to build peace, stability, and respect for human rights in the country.",False

Their motive was to shed light on how people find it odd and surprising for men to wash utensils in their household since women have been seen as the ones who do the chores. They may have failed to implement their campaign, but they bring out a few questions. If feminists actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering, how can anyone expect the world to find a man doing daily domestic chores as usual? Providing education, fighting for human rights in general, and being a good citizen just by respecting everyone's opinion are empowering. Feminism will take a turn back if it starts to point out how women cooking or cleaning is empowering when these are chores necessary in a domestic household, be it done by a man or a woman. If a man starts taking pride in doing the same, the backlash will be massive. The social stigma of a woman handling the household will end if people accustom themselves to a man taking over the role. In conclusion, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering isn't a step towards gender equality, not making a big deal out of a man doing basic chores is.","President Joe Biden ordered the US troops in Afghanistan to move out, allowing the Taliban to strengthen their grip over the nation of Afghanistan and take control once again after the incidents of 9/11. Driven by the motive to drive out foreigners and move back in, The Taliban waged devastating conflict over the years with the US army in which many lives were lost. Now, when POTUS has ordered an end to the war, Afghanistan is vulnerable and is now on its knees to the rules and restrictions of the Taliban.

Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering.

The problem with feminist movements is that they are often seen as political, whereas the truth is that we all have a common interest in having a healthy and happy life. So the way forward for feminists is to focus on the small things that we can all do to improve our lives. This means not only focusing on politics but also on personal development and strengthening our relationships with others.
","The Islamic Emirate of Taliban should be recognised by the UN because it is an Islamic government and it has a legitimate claim to power. It is also the only legitimate government in Afghanistan at present. The recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, should UN recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban? Justify your answer sufficiently.

The Islamic Emirate of Taliban have been fighting against foreign occupation for many years now. They have been fighting for their own rights and freedom. If the UN does not recognise them as a legitimate government, then they will continue to fight against foreign occupation and oppression by any means necessary.

The Islamic Emirate of Taliban has been recognised as a legitimate government by other countries such as Pakistan, India, Iran and China. The Muslims around the world support them because they want their country back at peace with all its people living peacefully together without any discrimination or persecution on religious or ethnic grounds.",False
5,1,Aditya Jain,"The notion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering is problematic for several reasons.
Firstly, it perpetuates the harmful stereotype that domestic work, including activities like gardening and cooking, is solely the domain of women. This stereotype has been used to justify the gender pay gap and to justify the undervaluing and underpayment of domestic workers, many of whom are women. By suggesting that feminists should reclaim domestic activities as empowering, we risk reinforcing this harmful stereotype and further entrenching gender roles.
Secondly, the idea that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering can put additional pressure on feminists to engage in these activities in order to prove their commitment to feminist values. This can be particularly harmful for feminists who do not enjoy or have the time or resources to engage in domestic activities. The expectation that feminists should engage in certain activities in order to prove their feminist credentials is both unfair and unproductive.
Finally, it is important for individuals to be able to choose their own interests and hobbies, regardless of societal expectations or stereotypes. This includes the choice to engage in domestic activities such as gardening and cooking, but it also includes the choice not to engage in these activities. It is not the place of feminists or anyone else to dictate what activities individuals should find empowering.
In conclusion, while it is certainly true that domestic activities can be empowering and enjoyable for those who decide to engage in them, it is not the responsibility of feminists to actively reclaim these activities. Doing so perpetuates harmful stereotypes, puts unnecessary pressure on feminists, and denies individuals the agency to pick their own interests and hobbies.","The situation of immigrants locked between the US-Mexico border is indeed perilous, and it is a reflection of the larger issues surrounding immigration policies in the United States. The rise of illegal activities, such as human smuggling and drug trafficking, along the border has had a significant impact on both the US and Mexico.
On the US side, illegal immigration has long been a contentious issue, with some arguing that it takes jobs away from US citizens and puts a strain on social services. However, it is important to recognize that many immigrants come to the United States seeking a better life for themselves and their families, and are often fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries. The rise of illegal activities along the border has also contributed to an increase in crime and violence in border communities.
In Mexico, the situation is equally dire. Many immigrants attempting to cross the border illegally are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse by smugglers and traffickers. Additionally, the heavy militarization of the border has led to human rights abuses against immigrants and Mexican citizens alike.
There are several potential solutions to this problem. One possible solution is to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty and violence in countries of origin. This could involve increased foreign aid and support for economic development in these countries. Another solution is to reform US immigration policies to provide a clearer path to legal status for immigrants, rather than forcing them to resort to illegal means of crossing the border. This could involve the implementation of a more flexible and fair system for granting visas, as well as a pathway to citizenship for those already living and working in the United States.
Ultimately, finding a solution to the perilous situation of immigrants locked between the US-Mexico border will require a comprehensive and compassionate approach that takes into account the needs and rights of all parties involved.

5,1,NOOR MEHRA,"ARGUMENT AGAINST THE MOTION 

There are three words in the above statement which absorb my attention; they are: ‘feminists’, ‘reclaim’ and ‘empower’. Feminists are people who believe in equal rights for men and women. This includes equal opportunities, equal rights, equal pay and the right to pursue whatever one wants in life; gender should not be a deciding factor as to who can do what. 
The dictionary meaning of reclaim is to retrieve what is previously lost and empower means to make someone stronger in controlling their lives and claiming their rights. 
Naturally, feminists already participate in domestic activities as they believe in equality of sexes, otherwise how would they be feminists? So, how can they reclaim something they already do? It’s the non-feminists who need to share the workload. 
Moreover, the point of feminism is not to fight about who needs to do the housework or domestic work. It is about letting every person chose what they want to do and empowering them to follow their choice. For example, if a woman wants to do housework by choice, there is no point in forcing her to do something else. For a woman who aspires to work outside the household, people related to her should call themselves feminists only when they share her load and make it possible for her to follow her dreams and aspirations. 
Therefore, I argue against the motion because the above statement does not make any sense. In true sense feminism is not about forcing men to do housework to call themselves ‘feminists’, but it is about giving freedom to everyone to be able to pursue their dreams. It is about putting an end to sexism. 
","I don’t think the UN should recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. Doing so would mean the acceptance of terrorism and spread the message in the world that it is okay to meddle with other country’s domestic affairs and government. If Taliban is recognised it could create havoc in the world in terms of terrorist accusations of countries all over the world. It would also violate international law in many forms. 

The Taliban is a terrorist group that has no intention of doing good, it is just to rip people’s peace of  mind and because of Taliban, the Afghanis are devoid of a safe country. Recognising Taliban would make Afghanistan the breeding ground of all major terrorist activities. 
The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.

Not recognising Taliban may pose political and diplomatic problems but recognising the terrorist group is not the solution. The people of Afghanistan need global support at this time because they can’t do anything on their own. The world needs to show sympathy for the distressed country and not turn its back on Afghanistan. It is not just Afghanistan’s war against Taliban, but a global concern.

5,1,Ayush Jain,"Against the motion:
In the ancient times, it was a common notion among the people that women should to take the responsibility of all the household work and called as the ""caretaker"" and Men should work outside and take the sole responsibility of earning bread and butter for the family. But in 18th and 19th centuries following the developments in the governance and toppling of monarchies into democracies and people realising their rights, feminist movements began to hold influence across masses. Women began to realise their rights which were away from just giving birth to children and raising them. They entered into political domain and asked for equal rights and evidently they succeeded at most of the places, broke away the boundaries of household and started chasing their dreams and aspirations.
Now as these feminist movements started from breaking away the gender biases in the type of work men and women should do, it is believed that feminists should simply reclaim domestic work which in my belief won't be right to say.
Our history is evident that women have to face a lot of struggle and a lot of them are still in such perilous conditions because of patriarchy and social injustices. But I believe that simply reclaiming domestic activities isn't a permanent solution to all these problems. The main problem lies in the line of thought that men are made for hard core jobs out of home and women should stay inside. This led to force both of them for particular jobs whereas they should be free to choose whatever they want to take up based upon their interests. 
Women should be let free to choose their dreams and aspirations. Things turns wrong when somebody is forced to do they don't want to just for the satisfaction of somebody else which in anyway should be rejected.","The Taliban is a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. Following the US-led invasion that toppled the original regime in 2001, the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory less than ten years after their ouster. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. The group’s swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.
Under their harsh rule, they have cracked down on women’s rights and neglected basic services. The Taliban threaten Afghans’ civil and political rights enshrined in the constitution created by the U.S.-backed government. Since regaining control, the Taliban have taken actions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the late 1990s. 
The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations:-
• The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down.
• Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared.
• The Taliban also reestablished their Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which under previous Taliban rule enforced prohibitions on behavior deemed un-Islamic. 
• Women have seen their rights obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working.
• Amnesty International reports a drastic increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male chaperone and to completely cover their bodies.
• The rates of child marriage have also increased. 
Given the above facts and many more stands out that simply Taliban-led couldn't be recognised. In today's world of social justice and democratic rules being accepted everywhere, a country couldn't be led by a militant group whose main objective is to win the war, spread terrorism around the globe and ignore the human rights issues in the country leading the nation in whichever way they want.
Also it is a fact that only three countries namely Pakistan, UAE and Saudi Arabia have came out to recognise this government which shows that most of the countries disagree with Islamic Emirates of Taliban. 
However, a lot of people are also agreeing with the Taliban-led Afghanistan seeing their recent efforts to ensure food security and other basic amenities which in my view just a political tactic to whitewash their dark image.
I strongly believe that United Nations shouldn't recognise this governance and should disband the current Afghanistan's Government in favour of common people of Afghanistan and their true development.",False

Popular feminist discourse downplays everyday cooking and gardening, implicitly defining it as the work of reinforcing women's second-class status. Combined with the epidemic of diseases caused by the conditions of the rural Indian households, the kitchen job has gained political significance. Neither feminist theorists nor environmental educators specifically include cooking in the kitchen or gardening in their discussions. By surveying of the local food and plant activist groups, it  gauges where feminists love to cook and nurture plants and develops feminist theories on gender integration. My debate depicts that feminists who work with local household conditions are just beginning to ideologically integrate feminism and cooking, gardening and various practices. But this connection is actually strong, and we argue that it's time to think of a new discourse on the kitchen or the garden for feminist groups and domestic theories comprising of the feminine gender .","2nd question-

5,1,Deepak Kumar Mandal,"Yes I agree feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. Feminism is a social, political, and ideological movement that seeks to advance the rights and status of women. One aspect of feminism is the idea that women should have the same opportunities as men to participate in all spheres of life, including traditionally ""feminine"" activities such as gardening and cooking. In the past, these activities were often seen as mundane or unimportant, and were relegated to women as part of their domestic duties.

However, feminists argue that domestic activities such as gardening and cooking can be empowering for women. These activities allow women to connect with nature, create beautiful spaces and nourishing meals, and express their creativity and independence. By actively reclaiming these activities as empowering, feminists can challenge the idea that they are lesser than or inferior to men, and can instead celebrate the value and importance of women's work.","Afghanistan has a long and complex history of governance. The country has been ruled by various empires, dynasties, and governments over the centuries, including the Maurya Empire, the Kushan Empire, the Persian Empire, the Ghaznavid Empire, the Seljuk Empire, the Khwarezmian Empire, the Mongols, and the Mughal Empire, among others.
In modern times, Afghanistan gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1919 and has been ruled by various governments since then. The country has experienced significant conflict and instability in recent decades, including a civil war in the 1990s and ongoing conflict with the Taliban and other armed groups. The current government of Afghanistan was established in 2001 after the fall of the Taliban regime, and has faced significant challenges in maintaining stability and providing effective governance for the country.


It is not accurate to say that Afghanistan has recently undergone a change of government or been annexed by the Taliban. The situation in Afghanistan is complex and ongoing, and the UN continues to recognize the government of Afghanistan as the legitimate government of the country. The Taliban is an armed group that has been in conflict with the Afghan government and has been designated as a terrorist organization by some countries.

The Taliban's rule in Afghanistan, which lasted from 1996 until 2001, had a number of significant effects on the country. During this time, the Taliban implemented a strict interpretation of Islamic law and severely limited the rights of women, including banning them from attending school and requiring them to cover themselves fully when in public. The Taliban also imposed strict rules on other aspects of Afghan society, including banning music and television and destroying historical and cultural artifacts that they considered to be against Islamic values.
The Taliban's rule was also characterized by widespread human rights abuses and the suppression of political opposition. The regime was accused of extrajudicial killings, torture, and the detention of political prisoners. The Taliban's rule was also marked by a lack of basic services and infrastructure, with many Afghans experiencing poverty, hunger, and a lack of access to education and healthcare.
The Taliban's rule came to an end in 2001 when the group was overthrown by a U.S.-led coalition in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Since then, Afghanistan has struggled to rebuild and establish a stable and effective government, and the country continues to face significant challenges, including ongoing conflict with the Taliban and other armed groups.

Many modern feminist tried to make us believe that domestic work , homemaker are something that holding women's back from the real power. Due to this many now lack in nurturing there own family.

Feminist like them were wrong because women's had power already to take care of their family by nurturing them with homemade foods and heal them when they get ill. Women's were not a mindless consumers but were producers. Modern feminist gave them a false narrative that doing domestic activities will make them less potential in businesses or in big corporations. And therefore they have traded the very important skill that is very necessary for self survival and for family health and well-being.

I think it is a good idea to reclaim domestic activities. But they should not do domesticity just because they think it is fun or to show empowerment. Rather because it is a smart decision. Also these skills are not only for Women. Men and women both need this to make their life more self sufficient and in their control. It is a powerful choice. It's sad that people think doing household work is old fashioned. It's the basic need for everyone and it should never go out of style.

There is a long history of devaluing and dismissing the contributions of women and femme-presenting individuals, particularly when it comes to domestic activities such as gardening and cooking. These activities have often been seen as ""women's work"" and therefore not as important or worthy as activities in the public sphere. This stereotype has been used to justify the exclusion of women and femme-presenting individuals from many areas of life, and to pay them less for their labor.

By actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists can challenge and subvert this harmful stereotype. It can be a way to assert agency and control over one's own life and home, and to celebrate the skills and knowledge that are often associated with domesticity. It can also be a way to reclaim and celebrate the cultural and historical significance of domestic activities, which have often been integral to the survival and well-being of communities.

For example, many domestic activities, such as gardening and cooking, involve a deep understanding of natural systems and the ability to sustainably provide for oneself and others. These skills have often been passed down through generations, and can be a source of pride and connection to one's heritage. By actively reclaiming and celebrating these skills, feminists can also challenge the notion that domestic activities are not ""intellectual"" or ""skilled"" work.

In addition, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can be a way to create more equitable and balanced relationships within households and communities. Too often, the burden of domestic labor falls disproportionately on women and femme-presenting individuals, leading to burnout and a lack of free time and energy for other pursuits. By actively reclaiming and valuing domestic activities, feminists can work towards creating more balanced and equitable relationships, where domestic tasks are shared more fairly.

In short, feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering because it is a way to challenge and subvert harmful stereotypes, assert agency, celebrate the skills and knowledge associated with these tasks, and create more equitable and balanced relationships.","Part - (1)

The situation for immigrants at the US-Mexico border is indeed a perilous one. Many immigrants, particularly those from Central American countries, are fleeing violence, poverty, and political instability in their home countries and are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States. However, the journey to the US-Mexico border is often dangerous, with immigrants facing risks such as human trafficking, abuse by smugglers, and attacks by criminal groups.

The rise in illegal activities at the border, such as human smuggling and drug trafficking, has had a significant impact on both the US and Mexico. It has strained the resources of border patrol agencies in both countries and has contributed to the overcrowding of detention facilities. The illegal trade in drugs and people has also fueled violence and corruption in the border region.

There are several potential solutions to this problem. One solution is to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability in Central American countries. This could involve providing aid and support to these countries to help them improve their economies and governance and reduce the incentives for people to leave.

Another solution is to improve legal channels for immigration and provide more opportunities for people to migrate to the US safely and legally. This could include increasing the number of visas available for immigrants, especially for those who are fleeing persecution or violence.

Additionally, it is important to address the issue of human smuggling and trafficking at the border and to provide support to immigrants who are victims of these crimes. This could involve increasing funding for law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute smugglers and traffickers, as well as providing assistance and support to immigrants who have been victimized.

These domestic activities are far from empowering. They are mere basic life skills that every individual should know how to perform. By reclaiming these activities, the women would just be going back to what has been expected of them for a very long time. It goes against everything a feminist has ever fought for. Feminists fought for radical and liberal reform on women's issues created by inequality between men and women. Empowering basic day-to-day activities like household chores unnecessarily glorifies what is normal and relevant to all.
 A large part of the population still consciously or subconsciously believes that household chores come as second nature for women. This is very much evident in how most of the time, women are expected to take care of all the household work as a part of their 'job'.
Empowerment of women involves boosting their self-esteem by making them aware of how much they can do and how the world is so full of new opportunities. It involves raising the status of women through awareness, literacy, and training. Domestic activities are not something that special emphasis should be laid on. This work is poorly-regulated and not even protected by labour laws. 
Empowerment through the reclamation of domestic activities would be unrealistic for informal workers. These activities would limit the women to their homes thus limiting their ability to explore. Thus, it would make more sense for the empowerment of women through income-generating activities. Women’s contribution to family income, participation in the household economy, and ownership of assets are what would make them feel empowered.","The shift in the condition of Afghanistan's government, in my opinion, has been a fairly disgusting deed. The Taliban terrorist organization is a mostly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist force that reclaimed control in Afghanistan in 2021 following a twenty-year conflict. The conquest of the state was not done in a fundamentally democratic manner, and it was detrimental to the nation's bulk people.

The United Nations, in my perception, should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as the new governing entity because the Taliban used violence strategically, exercising restraint to influence military assessments of their capabilities in order to encourage more rapid withdrawals from the original government. Taliban’s swift capture of Afghanistan was the product of not just tactical prowess, but also a relentless campaign to force surrenders and strike bargains. The militants used threats and enticements, as well as media and psychological warfare, to take city after city, some without firing a single shot, until conquering Kabul. 

The Taliban is not an institution that should be acknowledged by the United Nations since it is based solely on a vicious past filled with murders and bloodshed. The cold-blooded cruelty of the executions is also a reminder of the Taliban's prior record, as highlighted by Agnès Callamard, and a terrifying omen of what Taliban's power may bring. Another key reason why the Taliban should not be regarded as the reigning organization is that they have psychologically damaged future generations of their region. There has been a deep entrenched dread ingrained in the country's subsequent generations as a result of the Taliban's relentless terror and fear created by their many inhumane operations conducted in the past.

As a result, the United Nations is a forum that has been granted to nations to discourse and contemplate essential concepts, and all countries participating must be representative of a credible nation, therefore the Islamic Emirate of Taliban does not qualify.",False

Why should always the men be the bread earner, why should the girls be expected to learn to cook and handle household duties.

But I also believe that if a women wants to be a homemaker then that too should not be questioned. When it comes to equality then we need to understand we are talking about cerebral opportunities, we are not saying that I want to be able to participate in sports with a men as opponent. This is not correct as the physical differences sure does exist. We are saying that don't question a career oriented women about how she Will handle her family along with her career if you don't question a man the same , here we are presuming that the women is supposed to take up household duties and a man has no burden of it.

3,0,Parth Garg,"Feminism is a socio-political movement that aims to establish social, economic and political equality between the males and females. Feminism holds the position that society tends to show a male dominance and ignore the rights that should be given to the females. The feminists all around the world ignite sparks and ask for their rights from time to time. The main topic that they emphasize on is that the women should be provided with equal wages when working on the same post as a man in a company. Also, the feminists focus on letting women to leave all the daily chores such as cooking, washing etc. and only focus on earning huge amount of money as working professionals i.e. the works that require to sit in an office and work by leaving all the daily household chores. Yes, the women should be paid equal wages for the work they do as professionals but they should never forget about the contribution given by males in the society.
For example, whenever you call an electrician, plumber, mason, carpenter etc at your home for work, more than 90% of the cases you will always get a male to work. These are a set of works that only defined for the males. Then why can’t the females actually reclaim domestic activities. The feminists should also take up these domestic chores as a step to empower the entire female society that in this way they can contribute to the good of the society. There are a number of places that the males are more proficient in working and then there are places where females can be the better ones in handling them. Rather than discriminating the fact that why do only females do the domestic work, the feminists should also keep in mind that why do only the males do all the physical work. Maintaining the balance of the society should be the ultimate goal that everyone should keep in mind by considering all the past or present stereotypes as trash. The feminists should understand the fact that they should ask for equal rights in all the domains rather than just focussing on the money-oriented clean works. The thing that equal wages should be paid for the same work is a must but still to maintain the balance, the females should contribute by doing the domestic household works whereas on the other hand the males can do the physical work. The household works like cooking, washing, gardening can also provide a platform to unite the entire female society and help them empower themselves. It can also act as a major tool to maintain the balance. Lastly, the feminists should always focus on getting the equal rights but keeping in mind about the male aspect too. ","The conflict in Afghanistan took a dramatic turn with the withdrawal of all international troops, the collapse of the government, and the takeover of the country by Taliban forces. Taliban overtook the reign from the government of Afghanistan in 2021. It was a year full of hardships and a lot of casualties for the people of Afghanistan. The moto of the Taliban was to make Afghanistan as the Islamic Emirate of Taliban and get recognized worldwide. But they suffered a backlash when they found out that the countries of entire world are against them. Till this date, the Taliban have carried out mass and targeted killing of the people of Afghanistan over a period of time that either go against there ideology or try to oppose them in any way including human rights defenders, women activists, humanitarian and health workers, journalists, former government officials, security force members, Religious and ethnic minorities. The Taliban forcibly evicted thousands of people from their homes and land according to their personal thinking and the people have faced a lot of problems which in turn has also turned into a crisis. After the Taliban takeover, women have also lost many of their fundamental human rights. Despite reassurances from the Taliban that women’s rights would be respected, the limited progress made in the previous two decades was quickly reversed. The majority of secondary schools remained closed to girls. Intimidation and harassment of teachers and pupils led to low attendance rates, particularly among girls, even where schools and other education facilities were open. Violence against women escalated further from August when women’s legal and other support mechanisms began shutting down – in particular when women’s shelters closed. The Taliban’s ending of institutional and legal support for women left women at risk of further violence, and they feared the consequences of reporting incidents. Over the past year, Afghanistan’s economy has been on life support. Crippling sanctions against senior Taliban leaders have paralyzed the banking sector and prevented Afghanistan from engaging with the international financial system and its institutions. The value of its currency, the afghani, has plummeted, raising the cost of imports and exacerbating inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. In its April 2022 report, the UN team that monitors the Taliban said the group “remains close” with al-Qaeda and that “al-Qaeda has a safe haven under the Taliban and increased freedom of action.” Many Western countries, including the United States, shut down their diplomatic offices in Afghanistan after the Taliban took over. They have refused to recognize and establish diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, which calls the country the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In addition, the UN General Assembly has indefinitely postponed a vote on who can represent Afghanistan at the United Nations. So, concluding the article, the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban because of all the ill work done by the Taliban to the people of their country.",False
5,1,Shreya Garg,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, and cooking) as empowering. In my opinion, basic domestic activities are the basic and essential activities and tasks which every human being, be it a girl or a boy, should be taught. Cooking is an integral part of one's routine and should always be given priority. It makes a person independent and trains them to survive on their own. Hence, in developed countries like Japan and Canada, there is no culture of a housemaid, the members of the house are supposed to do the household chores by themselves. But, the opinion that only women should do domestic chores is wrong as it is an essential part of a person's routine which a man or woman, both, should be aware of. Hence, Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.","The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, twenty years after their ouster by U.S. troops.

No religion preaches to kill one another in the name of lord, nor it teaches to spread hatred just in the quest of finding as so called superior religion. The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities. U.N has the responsibility to promote non-violence and make sure that at least basic human rights are not being violated. Taliban is constantly violating basic human rights and needs , and hence, strict actions should be taken as soon as possible. Hence, UN must recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.",False

5,1,Shivansh Gandotra ,"No, women should not actively reclaim domestic activities such as cooking, gardening as empowering. Women must challenge these gender roles and stereotypes imposed on them as they don’t allow us to merge into one equal society. If these activities are to be accepted as empowering then they would only lead to enforcing the conservative stereotypes about women.  Domestic work and professional work are both equally important for the sustenance of the household but, in underdeveloped and developing countries like India, it is taken for granted that the women in the household will work inside the house and do all domestic chores and men will work professionally and gain money for the household. In countries like India, if feminists start reclaiming domestic activities it will only ostracise them from society and in ground reality, if we look at lower class households wherein women are mostly found doing major household activities these radical ideas would only lead to them being looked down upon by their conservative family members and lead to exclusion from society. Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering would only lead to enforcing the traditional stereotype that women are meant to do household work cook food and look after the children and they are not supposed to work outside the house.","No, The United Nations should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. The group has not been elected by democratic means and is involved in a number of human rights abuses. Ever since Afghanistan’s annexation by the Taliban, the country is in complete turmoil, many changes have been made and restrictions have been placed that violate the Doha agreement. Furthermore, according to a report by The United Nations mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), there have been human rights violations targeted at a number of groups including those associated with the ousted government, human rights defenders and journalists. The report said the hardest hit victims were those associated with the former government and its security forces, it listed 160 extrajudicial killings, 178 arbitrary arrests, and 56 instances of torture and ill-treatment of former government employees. The Taliban threatens Afghans’ civil and political rights and has re-established  The Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which under previous Taliban rule enforced prohibitions on behaviour deemed un-Islamic and the actions of The Taliban have led to civil unrest, protests and demonstrations especially for women’s rights.The Taliban has imposed a very strict interpretation of the Islamic law, minority and women’s rights are non existent. Under Taliban rule, girls who are older than 13 years are barred from attending schools and women have been barred from universities. There has been a drastic increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male chaperone and to completely cover their bodies. Women have been banned from parks, gyms and public baths. The rates of child marriage have also increased. The countries economic situation has also worsened since the Taliban took over and most of the population is suffering from some form of food insecurity and is unable to even afford basic necessities leaving people much more vulnerable to hunger and disease.",False
5,1,Garv Mittal,"The topic of Women empowerment has been the one of the most confusing controversial.
Somewhere , there are people who support equality amongst men and women where as the old school believes still prevail between us where we expect even a working women to handle the house chore, and with  time the role of feminists has changed .Initially when their main goal was to fight for basic rights for women has changed to increase the contribution in all fields and share stage with men where ever possible. 

Now, coming to the main topic , according to me domestic activities are something that should not become a huddle for women to stop her to unleash her potential , but at the same time the idea of  presenting these activities as odd and ugly is not a good one creating a doubt in minds of all the House makers , which make them suffer through FOMO, as these activities are not something that one should be ashamed of doing , as managing it is not everyone' cup of tea.

Thus feminists should reclaim these domestic activities as empowering as working in industry or gaining experience in market, or doing any research work, and leave it upto women to decide what they would like to do with their lives.

And instead of showing these activities as  ugly in front of women , one should show these activities as something that can' be neglected and hence each family member is responsible for these activities if the women of houses decides to take step forward to see this world .So just to summarize according to me domestic activities are as empowering as working outside but at the same time should not be a barrier for someone , if one decides to step outside of their house they should be supported by their family and not for only women but its even more empowering for men to carry out these activities going against the social conventions.
","According to me UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban. Since, the change of government , the Taliban has been imposing inhumane laws and restrictions on the people of Taliban, such as restricting girls to attend school and attain basic knowledge. I t also impose threats to give sanctuary to international terrorists in Afghanistan. Under the rule of Taliban the already suffering press freedom in Afghanistan is being killed brutally daily.
And recognizing such government would only mean to support terrorism across the world and not only that , but also will lead to much more weakening of US stance against Taliban , which will deteriorate  the economy of Afghanistan much more.
Due to the activities of Taliban , targeted killing of high profile Taliban supporters has increased which is making even the Taliban government unstable again, in this whole cycle the one suffering are the common people of Afghanistan , which is leading many people to flee the country .
So , one solution to all this is to break the cycle by making Taliban eradicate in Afghanistan, as there governance will make things just worser for Afghanistan .
And  even discussing about recognizing Taliban bring me to shame, as it goes against all the morals that UN or even jurisdiction under any legitimate governance stands for. Everyone knows about terror activities Taliban is linked with and recognizing Taliban will ensure the travel of officials of Taliban for different purposes, which might be some disguised terrorists and these people know how to create fake back history and get their work done under anyone's eye , and giving them access to exchange thoughts and ideas with high profile individuals can lead to extreme consequences, even the way Taliban has captured Afghanistan by force tells you a lot about itself and its ideology.

5,1,Dev Vats,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities(such as gardening, cooking) as empowering because feminism is not an idea about women/females absolutely leaving any and all activities which have been traditionally considered feminine. It is about equality, and particularly, equality of opportunity. If a person's freedom is curtailed and such work is forced against their will, they have all the right to express their choice and act accordingly; but as long as it is by choice and non confining in nature, domestic work should not be considered as chauvinistic or patriarchal. It is true, that by assuming activities such as cooking and washing to be inherently feminine, an continuous attempt to restrict/supress the female mind has taken place around the globe. But today's society, has evolved much further. Feminism strives to increase equality, giving the freedom of choice and ending gender stratification. If domestic work is considered absolutely equal to just any other work, which is done by an individual, by their own choice and will, it in no way harms the tenets of feminism. It is only wrong to assume that domestic work is for females. A woman can consider domestic activities as empowering, as long she herself believes that it is empowering, we cannot and should not tell her what to believe/think.  ","Given the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, I believe, the UN should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, because to have any positive impact on the lives of the Afghan people, the UN needs the Afghan government, even if it is the Taliban government. By recognizing the Emirate of Taliban, the UN will be able to open channels for communication and cooperation. On the other hand, if no official links are established, the Afghan society will become more and more insulated and isolated from the world and authoritarianism will rise. They will miss out from the benefits of globalization, and set a path towards restrictions and reductions in fundamental rights like the recently placed ban on women in universities. The UN should put restrictions and conditions on the support/recognition provided to the Afghan government so as to prevent the direct legitimisation of a government which has its foundations in terror and extremism. These restrictions/conditions should be removed in a phased manner based on the movement of Afghanistan and it's government towards a free and open society away from violence and extremism. If a total dismissal of the present state of Afghanistan is decided by the UN, it will be like an ostrich burying it's head in the sand to make the danger disappear. This will be very detrimental to the citizens of the world as Afghanistan will move to become a hotbed of terrorism.

5,1,Anant Kumar Shukla,"Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities, such as gardening and cooking, as empowering because these activities have historically been associated with femininity and have been used to limit and oppress women. By actively participating in and valuing these activities, feminists can challenge and subvert traditional gender roles and expectations. Additionally, engaging in domestic activities can be personally fulfilling and can help to create a sense of community and connection with others.

Additionally, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also be a form of resistance against the capitalist notion that domestic labor is not ""real"" work and is therefore not deserving of recognition or compensation. By actively participating in and valuing domestic activities, feminists can challenge the idea that these activities have no value and can work towards a society in which all forms of labor, including domestic work, are respected and compensated fairly. Furthermore, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can also help to reduce the burden of unpaid labor that disproportionately falls on women and can allow for greater equity and balance within relationships and households. Overall, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can be a powerful way for feminists to challenge and subvert traditional gender roles and expectations and to work towards a more equitable and just society.

In conclusion, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering is a complex and nuanced issue that can be seen from different perspectives. While some argue that doing so reinforces traditional gender roles and reinforces the idea that these activities are inherently feminine, others believe that it can be a powerful way to challenge and subvert traditional gender expectations and to create a more equitable and just society. Ultimately, whether or not feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering will depend on the specific context and goals of their activism. ","The perilous situation of immigrants locked between the US-Mexico border is a complex and deeply troubling issue that has far-reaching consequences for both the US and Mexico. The rise of illegal activities, such as human smuggling and drug trafficking, has exacerbated this situation and has had a negative impact on both countries.

In the US, the presence of illegal immigrants has been a controversial and divisive issue for many years. Some argue that these immigrants take jobs away from citizens and drain resources from social services, while others believe that they contribute to the economy and enrich the cultural fabric of the country. Regardless of one's views on immigration, it is clear that the current system is inadequate and has led to a humanitarian crisis at the border.

In Mexico, the situation is equally dire. Many immigrants, particularly those from Central America, are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries and are seeking a better life in the US. However, the journey to the border is often dangerous and many immigrants fall victim to human smugglers and other criminal elements. Additionally, the presence of illegal immigrants in Mexico has strained the country's already limited resources and has contributed to social and economic issues.

To address this problem, it is necessary to find long-term solutions that address the root causes of immigration and that provide a safer and more orderly process for immigrants seeking to enter the US. This may include addressing issues such as poverty, corruption, and violence in Central America, as well as implementing fair and humane immigration policies in the US. It will also be important to work with the Mexican government and other stakeholders to find ways to address the impact of immigration on Mexico and to support the development and stability of the region.

5,1,AAYUSH GOYAL,"Feminism is a movement that aims to achieve gender equality and challenge traditional gender roles that have unfairly disadvantaged women. Gardening and cooking seem as being the domain of women and have not been valuing as much as activities outside of the home. However, feminists should actively reclaim these activities as empowering for a number of reasons.

First, domestic activities can be deeply rewarding and can provide a sense of accomplishment and pride. By reclaiming these activities and valuing them as much as activities outside of the home, feminists can help to shift the societal perception of them and encourage their recognition as important and valuable work.

Second, reclaiming domestic activities can be a way to assert agency and control over one's own life. Too often, women have been told that their worth is tied to their appearance and their ability to conform to traditional gender roles. By taking charge of the household and caring for oneself and others through these activities, individuals can feel a sense of autonomy and self-sufficiency. This can be especially important for women who have been excluded from other areas of work due to discrimination or who may have been reliant on a partner for financial support

Third, reclaiming domestic activities can also be a way to resist the commercialization of these areas and the exploitation of women's labor. Many products and services related to domestic work, such as cleaning and childcare, are marketed towards women and often on cheap labor.

In conclusion, feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering and valuable forms of work that can bring a sense of accomplishment and self-fulfillment  By valuing these activities and challenging traditional gender roles, feminists can work towards achieving gender equality and creating a more just and equitable society.","The UN is an international organization that works to maintain international peace and security, cooperation among nations, and protect human rights.

It is noted that the Taliban, a military organization that ruled of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, is identified as a terrorist organization by the UN. During that time when the Taliban rule Afghanistan, Afghanistan became a hotbed for terrorism. TALIBAN once again forcefully take control of Afghanistan, it might be a chance for Afghanistan again to become a hotbed of terrorism.
Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, Taliban put various rules, especially for women which take over the basic human right like women will not take education, the hijab rule, and women always traveling with men also women did not travel alone in a taxi, and women alone did not go anywhere. If women protest against them, the Taliban use violence to stop them. The condition of women in Afghanistan is the worst.

Nowadays multitude refrains from doing domestic activities as they think that it would be not as useful and someone else can be paid to do that work. Most of the young generation think that doing domestic work is inferior and that they just want to do something more productive like a job or a startup. Indian society has an older mindset that only women should do domestic work which is slowly diminishing as women are getting ahead in other areas of work as well. On the other hand, many men still don't know how to proceed with domestic work like cooking, or cleaning. This should be changed actively and from a very young age. Cooking and cleaning doesn't need to be seen as a service provided to others. Instead, everyone should know that domestic work is something that an individual should know so as to suffice themselves when they're alone. Domestic activities help an individual to be independent and encourages one to stand up for them even in the hardest of the situations. Feminists should let people know that these activities are empowering and both men women should be able to the work which will help them in future.","Taliban are a predominantly Islamic group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021.

Pakistan was the first country to recognize the government and since then made persistent efforts to get the Taliban the country’s seat at the UN.  In 2021, the Taliban swept back into power. Effective control, does appear to have largely been satisfied, in that they are independent, arguably enjoy the habitual obedience of the population, and control the capital city. The recognition of governments is a highly uncertain area but I don't think the UN should recognize Taliban as a government,
Firstly because, no country in the contemporary era should acquire another country. Secondly, Taliban exploit many basic human rights of it's citizens. Whether they are able to stay in power in a sustainable manner is temporary and is  unclear, as of yet.
The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law. They have transitioned to a functional government. The Taliban threaten Afghans’ civil and political rights in the constitution created by the U.S.-backed government. Since regaining control, the Taliban have taken actions of their brutal rule. The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations. The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down.
Women have seen their rights exploited. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working.

5,1,Shubhra Singh,"I am against the motion that ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering"". We can't associate domestic activities or any kind of activity with empowerment. They are just manual skills a person may or may not have. A person's job, interests, religion, clothes, hobbies, skills , etc. is not a measure of empowerment.
Empowerment is about having a choice.
 This argument reinforces traditional gender roles and stereotypes, and suggests that these domestic tasks are inherently feminine. Instead, feminists should be free to choose the activities that bring them personal empowerment, rather than being prescribed certain actions. It is also important to recognize that empowerment is subjective, and that there are many ways to achieve it beyond domestic activities.
Encouraging these activities as empowering would give a lot of people a free ticket to do these and be considered a feminist when it's the bare minimum.
True empowerment happens only when we can manage to make our male-counterparts view and treat females and non-binary people as their equals.
I do believe that these skills should be learned by everyone without viewing them as empowerment. We should be able to view basic human tasks without the question of empowerment or gender roles in order to bring true change.

This shows that awareness can be raised among people. The UN recognizing the Islamic State would mean interaction with other countries and trade can be established again. A higher standard of living would prevent poverty. People can exchange ideas. People can actually take up issues like education and right to speech when their basic needs are met. The citizens are in no position to fight for these rights since they are in survival mode right now.
Hence, I firmly believe that the UN should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.",False
5,1,Tripti gusain,"I would like to debate for the motion. What one understands from the term women empowerment is to be given equal strata as the men in the society. Although unpaid women play an important role in ensuring food security and hygiene at household, even though women play such a significant role in maintaining a healthy society their work is often discredited .To all those women who keep their family, society and community away from all the ailments ,contamination should be recognised and their work should be dignified .A healthy society accelerates in progress .Discriminatory social norms often show household chores as insignificant and therefore, I feel it is high time that feminists aside from other concerns should voice up for empowering domestic activities and help them to reclaim the respect their work deserves. ","Recently, I came across a not so surprising but still enraging news of the declaration of the ban of women from universities in Afghanistan under the Taliban. This also saw protests from women and even fellow university male students, who walked out of the university showing their unity with the female students. As a female student myself, such injustice of denial of the right to higher education is a violation of human rights. But despite many such violations and wrongs committed by this totalitarian regime, the anarchy forces us to look up to the international bodies like United Nations for a global action other than mere disapproval. The same goes for the so called first world nations and superpowers like US, Russia, China etc., who claim to be the decision-making economies of the global system but leave alone any action or stern decision, some have not even expressed their displeasure towards such authoritarian regime and it’s human rights violation in the name of it’s policies. Infact, it is shocking to hear that there are indeed some countries like Turkey, who has called for recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Taliban despite such strong worldwide protests on their government, bringing back the brutal rule that Afghanistan and it’s people saw back in the late 1990s. Though no foreign country and the UN has given international recognition to these new rulers, in my opinion, there is a need of more strict and joint global action or sanctions instead of mere displeasure at their every act.",False
5,1,Samriddh Diwan,"I would like to say for the motion. Industrialization and world wars bought lot of people to jobs and businesses, but when we carefully examine today’s working class, we find, very few of them are passionate, others are just doing a job rather than having a career. Doing such menial jobs by women like accountancy, clerical jobs etc., deprives them with the time to look after their kids and household. Instead if they spend this time on their kids help in building their future, help them identify their career of interest and help in achieving it, they will impact society more and in a better way.
Secondly, work pressure and hectic schedule effect women health, which can be shown by decreasing fertility rate in women, which further result in disproportionate and unhealthy population, like one we see in Japan, where infertility rate has been dropped to 18.2% in woman, further Japan will see very few youths in comparison to older people in upcoming years.
Further it is far more satisfactory to raise a kid then doing a job, this fact was even shown by theatlantic.com when they surveyed their old batchmates, it showed many women, left their jobs to reclaim domestic activities like looking after their kids, even after their managers were ready to provide maternity and paid leaves, they did this because they wanted to help build career for their kids.
The main problem is we confuse women's empowerment and equality as the compulsion to do what men are doing, like doing a job or running a business, rather it's the right to do the things which help building a better future and nation.. ","Since the late 1900s, there has been an ever increase in number of immigrants at the Us-Mexico border, immigrants are attracted to better jobs and lifestyles in the US. A lot of immigrants had crossed the border and started to illegally live in the US, but this resulted in crime and illegal activities on both sides of the border which included human trafficking, drug trafficking, and due to this, from the last decade US government started putting a stop on this immigration, which forced immigrants to temporary settle at the border, making their life a misery.
Is it okay for the American government to do this? After the world war when they needed cheap labor, they removed all the restrictions on immigration, because that was for their benefit. But today when these immigrants are finding a place for livelihood, they just closed their borders. At one place the US describes itself as capitalist but, in its practice, it tries to be communist, for example, by introducing unfair acts such as “Title 42 Expulsion”, and treating immigrants inhumanely by being racist and treating them as animals.
To avoid mistreatment and perilous situation of immigrants, we first to identify the root cause of immigration, which includes poor living conditions, food insecurity, political instability, etc, the further immigration process can be eased by creating regional bodies and policies to coordinate migration policy, signing mobility agreements such as Mercosur, and having coordinated responses to regional displacement crises.",False

Domestic work and caregiving are often unpaid and undervalued, and it is important to recognize that not all feminists have the privilege or resources to engage in these activities. It is also important to acknowledge that domestic work and caregiving are not inherently feminist or empowering, and that true gender equality requires a reevaluation and redistribution of these responsibilities, rather than placing the burden solely on women.","It is not appropriate for me to offer an opinion on whether or not the United Nations (UN) should recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. The UN is an international organization that works to promote international cooperation and address global challenges, and its decisions on recognition of governments are guided by the principles of the UN Charter and relevant international law.

The process of recognizing a government as the legitimate authority of a state is complex and involves a range of political, legal, and diplomatic considerations. In the case of Afghanistan, the UN would need to consider the views of the Afghan people, the positions of the various parties involved in the conflict, and the broader regional and international context",Maybe
5,1,Kirti Garg,"Cooking is a basic life skill that enables a person to function independently. How can we empower a women if she is not even self-sustaining?
 Feminism , according to me is the joy or ability to make our own decisions without being judged. In this busy world, we should be able to feed ourselves without waiting for someone's assistance. Being clean and hygienic is a basic necessity, and an empowered woman can't afford to depend on others for her daily basics of life. Learning or knowing a skill never makes you docile, it always gives you an edge over others.
Many feminazi devalue these domestic skills and consider them a bootless errand. Maybe the persistent insistence on learning how to cook exacerbated their aversion towards cooking but still this cannot disparage the value of these skills. It's not possible that everytime someone would be present to serve or assist you.
COVID-19 was the time when everything was closed and people weren't able to hire house keeping. Women who could cook and clean their houses by themselves were able to adjust way more easily than those who didn't.
Being incapable to perform these skills won't help rather it would make you reliant on others. The more you take other's assistance the more they would have the chance to question or judge you. That's why feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering.
","No, UN should not acknowledge the Islamic Emirates of Taliban. The barbaric group used every vicious and fiendish way to capture the land and now wants recognition as an ostensibly new and improved government that functions for people's prosperity.
Taliban has a very long history of perfidy, savagery and reneging on its words. The jihadist group never practiced what they preached. Steps taken by them for and after the seizure proves that they shouldn't be accredited in any situation.
They have nothing to do with country's welfare  and are just concerned about their reign. They want control over a territory just to rule and promote their ideology; ideology that is oppressive towards women and minorities.
After taking Kabul, the Taliban has raided homes of several journalists and activists, killing and threatening them . People who carried and planted the Afghan republic’s standard, had demonstrated against the Taliban and were beaten up or killed. The Taliban has assured religious freedom to the minorities, including the country’s sizeable Shia population.But in the Hazara heartland, the Bamiyan province, the Taliban blew up a statue of Abdul-Ali Mazari, a Hazara Shia leader . Mazari had been captured, killed, and thrown out from a helicopter by the Taliban when he came to negotiate peace with them.The Taliban spokesman’s pledge to let women have the right to education and work was also contradicted by the fact that his men had turned away a female broadcaster Khadija Amin when she showed up for work that day at the same building. The next day the Taliban fired Shabnam Dawran, another female presenter at the state-owned television.

5,1,Ritu Kansal,"I am totally against this ideology. In modern society, where men and women have equal rights and opportunities, I don't understand why it's the woman's job to perform all the domestic chores. Such domestic activities should have 50-50 contribution from both male and female. The partners should not measure their contribution and work, instead they should help each other in the hour of need. I believe that if the feminists also begin accepting this fact that women should reclaim domestic activities, then gradually the era where it was considered women’s job to take care of the household will definitely return. Besides, it should be one’s choice whether to go after any job or not. 
To express my thoughts, I would like to give the example from our Bollywood industry where the actors, Mr Arjun Kapoor as Kabir and Mrs Kareena Kapoor Khan as Kia performed in the movie “Ki and Ka” where the so-called roles of a man and a woman were switched. Kabir took the responsibility of the domestic activities as a house husband and Kia tried to achieve her professional/ corporate ambitions. Even if the society blamed them, accused them for not following the norms of a regular marriage, they did what they wanted to. If Ka didn’t support Kia and Kia didn’t support Ka, then their dreams might have got shattered. 
In conclusion, domestic activities are not just one person’s responsibility but it’s the job managed by both male and female. Instead, I would suggest that domestic activities should never be associated with either male or female. It should be one’s own decision to pursue any career and it should not be pre-decided by the society.
","Taliban ruled most of the Afghanistan from 1996 until October 2001 and it returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, after twenty years. They indeed imposed rules and regulations which diminish the social, education, marital, political rights of women. For instance, it said that all women will be banned from employment. Many cases of sexual harassment, rapes came when Taliban gained rule. Taliban’s rules were not only a menace to women but under its rule, country’s economic situation has also gone down. The country has only experienced degradation and many organizations believe that in upcoming years, the economic health of the country would get worsen. As we know, that UN didn’t keep any official peacekeeping in Taliban, despite the fact that the victimized civilians have been calling for UN. In my opinion UN should consider Islamic Emirate of Taliban as it would somehow bring up the necessary solutions to the civilians in the country.",False
5,1,Yashika ,"When asked about the definition of feminism, many feminist would define it  as- the belief in social, economic, and political equality of the sexes. But who has defined what is socially equal? For one woman, her doing household chores and her husband earning bread and butter for the family is equal but for another woman it might not be. In today's world many feminist do not recognise domestic activities as empowering. The definition of feminism has gone astray. It has been moulded by pseudo feminist. The true interpretation of feminism is appreciating the differences between the two genders and to use there different abilities to the fullest. Doing domestic activities is empowering. It is not a gender based skill. One who is capable of doing chores such as cleaning, cooking, gardening etc has so much strength both physically and mentally. These are the basic life skills evryone must learn. Skill development is the key to improve household productivity, employability and income earning opportunities for women and for enhancing sustainable development and livelihoods. If done in a meticulously planned manner the domestic activities can open new doors of employment and income for women. Thus it can be concluded that 'Feminist should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering '.","On September 7,2021 the Taliban announced a 'caretaker government ' to rule Afghanistan. The announcement came weeks after the Taliban, a Sunni islamist extremist movement that ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001 retook effective control of the country with collapse of US- backed former Afghan government and it's security force amid the US military departure.
For decades a variety of islamist extremist terrorist group have operated in Afghanistan and the Taliban have related to them in different ways. Al Qaeda and the regional Islam state affiliate are two of the most significant of these terrorist groups and the Taliban's take over is likely to affect them in different ways. During their formal rule the Taliban had ""one of the worst human rights record in the world"". Since taking power in August 2021, Taliban officials have retreated their commitment to protecting women's right ""within framework of Sharia"". The Taliban are often portrayed as the prime drivers of Afghan's women's oppression. The Taliban's takeover has increased fears of sexual violence, retilation and has created long term concerns over the future of women's right under a Taliban government. The Taliban have broken multiple pledges to respect human's rights and women's right since taking over Afghanistan a year ago. The economy has collapsed, largely because governments have cut foreign assistance and  restricted international economic transactions.
Thus considering the recent changes under Taliban government the UN shouldn't recognise the Islamic Emirate of Taliban as it is not working for its people. The condition of the country is getting worse. If it gets recognised the condition will only become more sevr. ",False

Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering will only put women at a loss as this will facilitate the conservative ideas of this patriarchal set up, we live in. yes, we all have to agree every person have the right to choose for themselves and that’s called empowerment but is it the right time for reclaiming domestic work as empowering while we have a lot to do towards setting the gender equality actually on the ground level not on paper only. 
Our society consider domestic work as something to be done by women only because it does not require much education and they would not need to step out of their house we can never neglect the fact that some humans irrespective of their gender prefers to actively participate in their home chores but assuming that women always like playing this part in their house is not good for our society.
As being a feminist, we should always keep the flag of demanding “equal opportunities” high in terms of education, jobs or having the right to choose for themselves. Women are the most potential creatures when it comes to multitasking, yes, they work in corporate and they raise their kids, they cook food for the family but do they choose to be like this or they have to be like this just because they are not men.","No, United Nations should not recognise Islamic emirate of Taliban. Taliban has taken control over Afghanistan by force overthrowing Islamic Republic of Afghanistan which was internationally recognised.

Taliban’s political system is highly Underspecified and highly undertheorized they have offered vague insistence that they will rule only in accordance with Islamic laws and has rarely talked about legal and political principals. They also left ministry of women’s affair vacant and later disbanded, and all appointed minister were men only. They revived their so-called morality police and enforced strict dictates on social behaviour: Dancing, Music, Gender Integration and even TV and radio were banned. They had shut down the courts and prosecution offices that judged violations of women’s rights removing women’s access to human rights.
The UN has called for “the establishment, through inclusive negotiations, of a government that is united is united, inclusive and representative with the full, equal and meaningful participation for women”, united nations has continued to recognise the Islamic Republic as the country’s legitimate government.

5,1,Anshita Dixit,"Gender roles have been perpetual since times immemorial.From the invisible labour going unrecognised to women bearing the brunt of the social norms that propel such stereotypes, the disparity is very prominent.Household labour and domestic activities often go unnoticed and are not paid jobs,hence are unrecognised even by the ones living under the same roof.Now, if one were to say that feminists should actively reclaim these domestic activities as empowering, i would partially agree primarily because of the power dynamics of the house that come into play, it's the one who handles the house, the one who's making sure everything's in place and the one who manages the ration and budgeting of the house that is the real manager and undoubtedly in an empowering position.But again,we don't live in Utopia, paid jobs are valued way more and to an extent rightly so because of the financial independence and a sense of individualism that it provides, men do these domestic activities when paid for doing them, be it gardening, cooking or cleaning.As a fellow feminist, needless to say i definitely support the idea of giving more credit and value to the women in the domestic arena than what they usually get , i donot intend to glamourize the highly problematic and debatable notion of one reclaiming these activities as empowering considering the sexist connotation and a history of sexism attached to it.There should be a divide of labour irrespective of one's gender in each household and if we're specifically talking about a housewife or a househusband, then it should be decided by mutual understanding.But to reclaim such activities as empowering could have two plausible arguments, first one being a regressive take as mentioned above and the other being the positive aspect of considering the one in domestic arena as being in a position of power.I'm still inclining towards claiming this to be rather a regressive take.","Since its takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, Taliban has been campaigning for its international recognition as the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.Most of the countries have kept mum about it and have been diplomatically handling this situation.Taliban had formed an interim government and talked to various heads of states and tried to show that their new way of governance was rather a better and improved one and that they should be internationally recognised but I strongly disagree with this.Firstly, its claim of being a legitimate government is utterly preposterous since it gained territorial control by force and carrying out extrajudicial killings and using unlawful tactics.No popular support and domestic recognition was observed whatsoever.Apart from that,their promises to take care of human rights of their supposed citizens were also false as they banned the women from attending University and snatched their right to education just like that.The UNSC also emphasized that recognising a government formed by violence and force would only send an encouraging message to other organisations to overthrow their government and form illegal regimes.Even the Cabinet Ministers of the government formed by Taliban are UN listed terrorists.They are an integral part of this regime. Recognising them would only show that the UN or any other state blatantly supports terrorism and the outright violation of human rights.Taliban did not even hold any election or referendum and has been oppressing the Afghans after seizing control of Kabul.Taliban has been trying to project a false image of a more moderate regime, better than the 1990s one to gain international support while blatantly violating human rights by carrying out public executions, ethnic cleansing and suppressing women and their rights.Whether or not to recognise it as a legitimate government should not even be a question in the first place.",False

It’s an important job to perform and without skills like gardening and cooking to it’s hard to survive and whoever is performing these skills be it for themselves or people around them, it’s still a huge problem in our society to look down upon people who only do domestic activities and no regard for the people who perform them even when people who perform these activities are very essential in our life. For centuries domestic activities have been regarded to as a women’s job and it being an easy job which is definitely not the case, and it is very essential for feminists to reclaim these activities as empowering and supporting these activities because performing these activities is not a sign of being weak it is a sign that they possess this skill and have many more skills which are being used in multiple different jobs. There needs to be more awareness spread on this topic and everyone should know that this is not anyone’s job and anyone who performs these activities is very essential in our lives and feminists should be empowered of this skill and this shouldn’t be looked down upon by anyone.

Imposing a certain profession on someone can be, and is, disastrous for not just the person, but indirectly the entire society and country. Also for a nation to flourish and prosper, it must be at social peace. The biggest enemy of growth can be a ""Status Driven Society"". to fight and win over this enemy, as a society we have to accept and respect all (legal) professions and walks of life/lives. keeping such points in mind, coming back to the main point: Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. The shortest answer is YES! and why just the women, everyone must because this discussion is not about male-female, rather it is mostly about who is the ""breadwinner"". But one thing is certain a ""breadwinner"" does not build a family, the ""bread maker"" does! Any profession can be empowering, as long as the person involved feels that she/he is feeling empowered and are making a difference (which they certainly are). Now, orthodoxically, the said ""breadwinner"" is a man whilst the ""breadmaker"" is a woman. This point made has nothing to do with the sex of a human but actually a specific role of a human, escpically in a family. After breaking these barriers and stereotypes, one may feel empowered.

The major reasons of failure of ANA were low morale, internal rifts and distrust, weak leadership and no air support. The regime of Ghani was resting on various fault lines. Since democracy was imposed on this landlocked cold-desert of a war-torn country, after being under turmoil since 1978 (USSR invasion and 2001 US-NATO invasion). The leaders lack/ed ideology and a reason to run the nation and to fight for the same against the Taliban. It is clear that the country was being held together by the occupying US-led forces. This being a nation where people hold loyalties to tribes and/or regions. Corruption and incompetence within the Afghan government and ANA were the reasons as to why the regime of Ashraf Ghani crumpled so easily. The Taliban , as opposed to Ghani regime, has a very strong political ideology. With such a government in place, the nation would become stable and at civic ease, Hence not only for itself, but for its entire neighborhood, it would be a great step to peace and stability and hence growth and prosperity, especially in the China-Indian sub continent region. The Taliban, were formed back in 1994 as a single coalition of Mujhaids that were armed and funded by US to fight the USSR and eventually pushing the Soviets out in 1989. 2021 is not the first time when Taliban was incharge, for a brief stint between 1996-2001, it ruled the Afghans under a very strict Sharia-Rule. Taliban is not the only political party that runs their country as per Islamic law; absolute or to some civil/criminal levels. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, Pakistan are few such examples. One interesting observation to make would be that the aforementioned states happen to be very close Allies of US/NATO and their allies. Similarly China and Russia have such close Islamic nations as allies (like Iran and Turkmenistan). Also the US-led occupying coalition ISAF signed a peace treaty with Taliban, in 2020, and so it passed on the baton to Taliban in 2021. Making legally bound to adhere to this treaty. So recognition of nation on the basis of ""Religious laws"" is out of question. Although, as nothing in the world is perfect, and hence there would be some groups of Afghans who would suffer. The world fears dropping of the standards of living and loss of human rights. And sadly this fear, slowly but progressively, is becoming a reality. Herein the USHRC can come to the aid of people and the same aforementioned neighbors can help by industrializing and urbanizing the nation so as to increase the income and incentive for the people. Instead of letting all of the development go in vain, it can be used as the new level to take off to newer heights. Thus creating a win-win situation This step would help the public to accept their new government, which happens to be the most important thing for a stable and growing nation. This can materlise only when countries setup diplomatic relations with the current government and finally accept the legitimacy of the Taliban regime",False
5,1,Shivangi Prasad,"""Empowerment is great, but toxic empowerment is not.""
In this era of rising feminism every now and then, in each part of the world, we see women protesting for their rights to be treated equally as men and the other genders. They would want equal job opportunities, equal pay and respect in offices and the society. Everything seems fine but things go down then few feminists turn into ""pseudo feminists""; They would want everything equally as men but wouldn't want to do the home chores and domestic activities like gardening, cooking, cleaning etc. This mindset could have many reasons, but one of them in my opinion is the mentality of considering these tasks as unworthy and not empowering. They would want men or their servants to do them because they feel they've done enough of it and now it's their time to shine. Whereas, the fact is, every task that makes a human, be it a man or a woman or any gender- independent and responsible is considered to be empowering. Whether it is cleaning, dusting, cooking or earning money by a job; they are the basic tasks needed to be done by a civilized human being to live peacefully on their own. Hence I feel any work of a human's basic need should not be considered as unworthy or disgraceful and all the feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.","Taliban has been trying to capture over Afghanistan since long time and got successful a few times too. However, the government of Afghanistan got its powers back every time. But this time after the recent annexure, the whole government and economy of Taliban has been destroyed. The situation of the country has been really meagre and pathetic. Due to the terrorist attack, thousands of citizens died. Many tried to escape through flights and go to a different country, but many died in those attempts too; people were hanging on the wing of the airplane, out of which many dropped mid-air and died then and there.
American government has been keeping Afghanistan safe since 2001 till 2020 due to the 9/11 attacks but after the death of Osama Bin Laden (supposed to be dead) it didn't care much. In 2021-22 when it was supposed to be saving and helping the Afghanistan government by providing its armor and forces, it backed out. This turned out to be a golden opportunity for Taliban and hence resulted in capture of Afghanistan easily by a terrorist attack.
After the captivation, the situation of the locals got deteriorated. Laws got changed and they are living in misery till date. The women were not allowed to get out of their houses and kept captured like prisoners. Female students were expelled out of colleges and schools and aren't able to attend them till date. Although the women can step out now, but they still are forced to wear a hijab.
Considering the whole scenario, the Taliban asking for recognizing the country as the Islamic Emirate of Taliban is extremely unjust and cruel. If UN agreed to recognize it as the Islamic Emirate of Taliban, the condition of the people would degrade even more. Also, this would give rise to terrorism and encourage the practice indirectly. Taliban's target to capture the entire world may seem approaching soon and would be a huge threat to the world harmony.
Hence, I feel given the recent change of government in Afghanistan and its annexation by the Taliban, the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban and help Afghanistan regain its recognition, government and freedom back.",False
5,1,Shreya Sharma ,"“Feminism is basically Humanitarianism “ is what I believe . Half of the world is under a truly false idea that feminism lays high stress on women empowerment or hating men and believes that women are superior than men. However i strongly believe that Feminism isn’t about making women stronger. Women are already strong, it’s about changing the way the world perceives that strength. 
The same goes for the activities that exist and are considered humane to be done, be it boxing, weightlifting, cooking, babysitting or gardening, everything can by done by a well sound human. Howsoever these activities have been considered highly feminine from a very older era. The world needs to understand that basic activities like keeping a household, gardening, cooking etc simply need the presence of mind and four limbs, these can be carried out by both men and women irrespective of their origin or any else matter for the fact. Women are always saying ‘We can do anything that men can do’ But I believe men should be saying ‘ We can do anything that women can do’ I believe this notion should be popularised by feminists to set clear that gardening and cooking etc are empowering enough to keep the sense of feminism that is, equality, alive. ","After 40 years of civil war, Incremental Peace in Afghanistan highlights a need for a radical new approach to peace in the country- one that builds progressive steps towards peace and includes Afghan society as a whole. It argues that the process must begin with measures to reduce violence as a basis to build confidence in a more fundamental change over time.  The United Nations is out one great hope for a peaceful and free world. 
It’s system is still the best instrument for making the world less fragile.  Afghanistan is at a crossroads facing two possible futures: indefinite violent conflict, or gradual progress towards sustainable peace. Choices made now over strategy, tactics and resources can tip the balance either way, and The United Nations has a critical role to play in promoting stability, security, human rights and economic development. The UN is as relevant today as at anytime in its history. 
I believe an incremental approach must pursue two objectives: First short term to reduce conflict which inevitably involves central role of the two parties, principally the Taliban and Afghan government.

46,0,Kunjal das,"Ever since the revolution of feminism started, the one topic which is constantly being brought up is domestic activities. Women say that it is high time they are not the only ones in charge of all the household work and others must also take charge. As a result, neither men nor women are willing to take up the duty. In my opinion, domestic activities like cooking, cleaning, and gardening are not something that is to be taken up as a choice or a duty. It is a life skill that irrespective of gender, age,  and status should be learned by all. Cooking is a basic skill that is required to survive, it should not be put as a burden on any person. Feminism is all about the equality of men and women and I strongly believe they should both equally contribute to domestic activities. It is not something that should be seen as a regressive activity. Just because a woman chooses to take care of the home doesn’t mean she is not a feminist or does not believe in equality. It is an equally important duty that should not be looked down upon. In fact, it is empowering that one can take care of themselves and not have to rely on others for their basic needs. Instead of running from it, it should be appreciated and respected.","In Houston, a lot of the illegal stuff you see is human trafficking rings, a rise of theft, stuff being stolen and brought back to Mexico for sale (cars, tools, and more). I think the illegal activities are really hurting the ""everyday"" people who work for an honest living with people here in America worrying about theft and their kids safety.

Their work makes it possible for you to balance your lives, ensure your families are safe and healthy and keep your life in order. Women’s empowerment should start when we teach them the value of their work in our lives and when they will realize their actual worth we can spot the difference.

It is the duty of a woman to woman to take care of her family and house. This has been passed down from generation to generation. Historical reasons support my argument, but biological reasons further it. Biologically, a woman's body is less muscular, more capable of multitasking and generally more warm, making it perfect for domestic activities compared to a muscular body, and in general better IQ of men, making them better for the outside world. 

Feminists and society as a whole should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. Not doing so leads to an upsurge in women, resulting in poor efficiency. This can lead to improper upbringing, improper management of household works and a general disbalance in the life of the whole family.

Domestic activities are in trend in this age of technology. Cooking is a whole vast field of study and a profession in itself, and so is gardening. Instead of thinking of them as futile jobs, women should try to get better at them and if possible, try to earn some money from them. Well-off people are sitting at home and exploring the peaceful life brought possible only by focusing on their environment, primarily their home.

As seen by historical and biological reasons, Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. They should feel a sense of pride in performing these activities and constantly try to get better at them. ","Taliban is a terror group led by Mohammed Omar and Abdul Ghani Baradar. They led 
 a militant political movement in Afghanistan. It has been the main reason for disrupt and insurgency in the country. 

The main motto of the Taliban is the spreading of Islam and revoking women of their fundamental rights which include the basic right to education, movement and expression. They have made wearing a burqa mandatory for women at all times in public. Women are brutally beaten, publicly flogged, and killed for violating Taliban decrees. Taliban is biased to such an extent that women are sacked from their jobs and those jobs are given to men. Now women, even those with high educational backgrounds are made to sit at home or sent to specific places where they can work.

 The Taliban's horrifying human rights record and their unwillingness to meaningfully engage with international financial institutions have furthered their isolation which has led to the further degradation of Afghanistan's economy. 

The United Nations should not recognise the Islamic Emirate Of Taliban. Recognising Taliban legitimate would be like igniting the ideology of terrorism as it would give terrorists the power to do anything and get away with it which would put the people of the whole world at a huge risk. Taliban overthrew an existing democratically elected government and took over the country with military strength. After taking over the country they deprived women of their basic rights, increased radicalisation in the country and further degraded the economy of Afghanistan.

46,0,Avni gupta,"Empowerment is not a goal, but a foundational process that enables women to construct their own agendas and form movements and struggles for achieving lasting transformation in gender and social power structures.
This kind of empowerment might contribute to achieving a more just and equal world. We see, time and again, that transformations in consciousness along with collective action constitute a mode of challenging and gender and power relations that is a far cry from today’s diluted discourses of empowerment-lite. 
In my opinion, feminists, as they call themselves nowadays, should reclaim domestic activities such as gardening, cooking, cleaning, washing as empowering. These activities are not meant only for women, these are basic activities meant for all. Each person should be familiar with how to perform them. Though some people are of the opinion that these should be only performed by women, or home-makers as they call them. 
To me, women empowerment means to work with women, not for women; don’t tell women what to do to change their lives but share your knowledge and skills so they can figure out how to do it; you cannot do much for them economically, but help them eradicate the poverty of their ideas and dreams — show them new ways of understanding the world. Help women be heard by those who don’t listen to them. And when they find the path they wish to tread, first, walk in front of them; then, when they are stronger, walk beside them; and finally, when they are truly strong, walk behind them, so that if they should stumble and fall, you will be there to help them get up and walk again.
Supporting women and those that empower women, is essential to achieving gender equality. Working with women to navigate the legal system, or supporting women entrepreneurs in your community, you can make a difference.","Following the U.S. led invasion the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. The group’s swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a peace agreement with the Taliban. The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite laws to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.
The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human rights violations. The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading a number of news organizations to shut down. Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared. Women have seen their rights obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working. A drastic increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male chaperone and to completely cover their bodies has been recorded. The rates of child marriage have also increased. 
The UN Security Council first imposed sanctions on the regime for harboring al-Qaeda in 1999 and expanded the sanctions after 9/11.
In the unlikely event that the Taliban is not yet legally the government, minimum international obligations still apply to it, thereby reducing any legal vacuum. First, UNSC sanctions apply to the Taliban as a group and to associated listed individuals and entities. These include an assets freeze, an arms embargo, and a travel ban.

5,1,Ashmita Banerjee ,"Say for example you and your friends are having a discussion on household chores, and all of you claim to be feminists, I can still say with uttermost confidence that the first picture that pops up in your head is a woman handling all domestic activities. Taking into perspective the topic of the house “Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering” I would like to put forth my views against the motion. 
According to a survey conducted my National Statistical Office on time use women are overwhelmingly involved in work they do not get paid for. Some 84 per cent of women's working hours are spent on activities they do not get paid for, while for men, the reverse is true - 80 per cent of their work time is spent on activities they get paid for. Domestic activities can be looked up to as empowering if they are recognized as a legitimate form of work and labor for which people get paid as nothing is more empowering than financial independence. It took years of universal suffrage movements for women to get out of their houses and have a vote in who runs their country and to go back behind those doors only calling it empowering will be a shame. In my opinion even after 150 years from the time the term feminism was first brought into context household chores are more associated to femininity than feminism. Men who call themselves feminists and actively take up housework are either given a special mention or have the tag of someone emasculate. The argument should pertain to whether or not the burden of housework is being shared between both genders which will help in defining what feminism actually stands for. Some of the main reasons that girls are less likely to reach optimal levels of education include the fact that girls are needed to assist their mothers at home, have been raised to believe that a life of domestic work is their destined occupation. We need to understand that the concept of feminism has not yet penetrated to the grass root level where girls who could actually benefit from such an idea are stuck in the shackles of household chores. Lastly, domestic work is not something to be looked down upon (thanks to covid, we know!), but for it to be termed empowering is not the need of the hour. ","Some Countries have terrorists. Now terrorists have a country.
Afghanistan has gone to the hands of Taliban. Ironically after the bloodless coup it was the Taliban that was allowing passage and fixing the deadline for the USA and other world powers to evacuate.
After effectively rebuffing the British empire and the Soviet Union in its long and blood soaked history, Afghanistan again proved to be a land that delivered a humiliating defeat to be the world's biggest superpower in their longest war which took the lives of 2,400 US soldiers and more than 71,000 Afghan and other civilians.
Now the big question, should UN recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban?
For this we need to understand in all capacities what the Taliban stands and its policy; Whether and how much the Taliban have changed since their repressive rule over Afghanistan before the fall of 2001 is key to how far a social and political atmosphere can be retained and created in Afghanistan that is acceptable to all people of the country as well as the international community.
But these utterances of their policy adjustments appear to have been largely driven by political imperatives such as the immediate one of getting international legitimacy rather than any fundamental changes in ideology. Given their continued domineering behaviour, intolerance of political dissent and oppression, especially towards girls and women, there is legitimate concern that as soon as the political pressure diminishes, they will revert back to old 2001 practices.
The UN need to make a very well constituted and informed decision on the Taliban as military takeover will not be an answer this time. Both sides of the party need to have a diplomatic round table and agree on a certain set of rules mutually which aids in the peaceful functioning of the country because stability of this country directly influences Asia and hence the rest of the world. The geopolitical implications need to be analysed and fully understood before any decision is made. The answer to this question will depend on the amount of transparency the Taliban allow for the rest of the world to judge their governance and a check on the arms influx from the middle eastern countries. The hold which Taliban has on their land can be used as a factor to turn things around and start afresh with no discrimination within their own communities with an added watchdog community from the UN.

The much expected collapse of Kabul came earlier than expected giving rise to the Islamic Emirate of Taliban.Ever since then,an already poor country has worsened to a collapsed economy with a broken banking system.In October 2021,more than half of Afghanistan's population faced an acute shortage of food.The Taliban has made Afghanistan a safe heaven for terrorists including the al-Qaeda.It is also known for restricting press freedom,obliterating women rights,executing the Sharia Law amongst various other practices going against the US-backed and a universally acceptable constitution.A country is supposed to be governed by a sophisticated modern institution with credible diplomats and not by a violent group of conservative leaders.

5,1,Vidhi Pandey,"Feminism is a word that symbolizes a very strong emotion. As women have been emerging in every sector and empowered to work in every field this particular word has become a very strong notion. It is often misunderstood and taken in the wrong sense.

Women have been striving so hard and leading a double life; both as a career women and a housewife just in order to prove themselves. So, does one have to become the bread earner of the family in order to gain some respect and achieve the so-called notion of ""feminism"". Not really.
As much as we try to avoid it the society as we have it right now is built on the founding pillars of patriarchy and women have had to step out in the field in order to prove themselves. Now comes the important point as to why are domestic activities equally important .
Even though we don't give it much importance but being a house wife is equivalent to a 2487 job. You are always committed to it. Women have the gift of bearing kids and have to often step down and compromise in jobs which they compensate by doing such domestic work. The issue that we face right now is the stigma related to these tasks.
The stereotypical image of working women being feminists is wrong. Every women should have equal rights and equal respect in the society despite what they do. We should acknowledge the fact that domestic activities are equally important as others and women should be encouraged and should feel empowered to do so.",No. Afghanistan as it is annexed by Taliban as of now was under a similar situation back in 2001.

Feminists should not feel obligated to reclaim domestic activities as empowering because these activities are personal choices that should not be dictated by anyone.

The rise in illegal activities, such as human trafficking and drug smuggling, has had a significant impact on both countries and has contributed to the dangers faced by immigrants.

One of the main problems is the lack of a clear and fair process for immigrants to legally enter and seek asylum in the United States. This has led to many individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, which puts them at risk of harm and exploitation by criminal organizations. In addition, the lack of adequate resources and infrastructure at the border has led to overcrowding and substandard living conditions for those who are detained.

There are several potential solutions to this problem. One is to increase funding for and capacity of legal ports of entry, so that immigrants can safely and efficiently seek asylum.

Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering because they have historically been associated with women and femininity, and therefore have been devalued and undervalued in society.

5,1,Mehak Kala ,"I strongly feel that as feminists,we should actively reclaim activities considered domestic or traditionally ' feminine ' such as cooking, cleaning or doing household chores and work toward undoing the notion that they are trivial  pursuits .

The very  quintessence  of feminism is providing choice.Feminism upholds every individual's right to choose what their happiness or satisfaction lies in .It doesn't vilify  women  who choose to be housewives or enjoy domestic activities. For ages we have been socially indoctrinated to associate femininity  with weakness, superficiality and inferiority ;which is a false and harmful notion to perpetuate .It is a well documented fact that traditionally female dominated occupations (such as nursing and elementary school teaching ) have lesser pay since when a job is dominated by women ,it is valued less ,even if it requires the same skills as a male dominated one.In fact the Department of Labor of the United States of America released new data that shows the gender wage gap still persists, with women being paid on average 83 percent of what men are paid.

 Since stereotypically 'feminine 'interests and hobbies are so often mocked and belittled as frivolous,many young women have a '-not- like- other -girls ' phase stemming from internalised misogyny .Moreover, being equipped with basic domestic skills is a pre- requisite for any independent adult ,regardless of gender .These constitute necessary life skills required for survival and hence should be encouraged in both boys and girls ;and should not be condemned 
.Hence for all the aforementioned reasons ,empowering individuals who partake in domestic activites of their own volition,and actively discouraging the notion that the latter are worthless or inferior becomes an inherently feminist act.","On August 15,2021 the Taliban ( a Deobandi Islamist fundamentalist and Pashtun nationalist militant , political movement in Afghanistan)captured the capital Kabul during withdrawal of US troops from the country,and subsequently annexed and have control of  over half of Afghanistan's 421 districts .
They have committed grave violations of human rights including curbing the fundamental rights of women and minorities.Recognition of such a state which is at loggerheads with the very idea of a democratic republic would be a disservice to the millions suffering under their unjust and near totalitarian regime .
It will also give the wrong message to other extremist movements.While it becomes necessary to acknowledge them in order to condemn their activities,the United States should not give it Afghanistan's seat.
There are several reasons for this ,both from an ethical,moral standpoint and a prudential one.If the UN recognises the Islamic Emirate of Taliban,it threatens to compromise crucial axioms of international law and policy and would have grave consequences ,both domestic and international.Recognising them as legitimate undermines the right of the people of Afghanistan to choose their leaders on their own , which is a basic tenet of democracy.The UN has always strictly safeguarded what constitutes a legitimate government and only recognised ones which fulfill the necessary criteria.For example,in 1974 South Africa had its UN recognition and representation suspended due to its inhumane apartheid regime .
The Taliban took control of Afghanistan by illegitimate, extrajudicial and forceful means ,and does not represent the Afghan people.  Hence the UN should not recognise it as such .After all,as an oddly wise Barbie doll in 'Toy Story 3 'once said,""Authority should be derived from the consent of the governed,not from the threat of force !""

46,0,Tanay Gupta,"I support the motion that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering.
Historically these domestic activities have always been associated with women and are used to discriminate against them, reclaiming them as empowering can be a form of resistance against societal expectations and gender roles. Feminism is about achieving equality and challenging societal norms and expectations that disproportionately impact women.It can also be a way for feminists to take pride in and find joy in activities that have been traditionally undervalued and underappreciated.

Additionally, domestic activities such as gardening and cooking can provide a sense of accomplishment, creativity, and agency, which can be empowering for individuals.It can also be a way to connect with nature and contribute to the sustainability of our communities. 

Overall, reclaiming domestic activities as empowering is a way for feminists to celebrate and value the skills and labor that have often been dismissed as ""women's work,"" and to challenge the idea that domestic activities are inferior to more ""public"" or ""professional"" endeavors. By actively embracing and valuing these activities, feminists can challenge and change these harmful stereotypes and expectations, and reclaim them as valuable and empowering pursuits.","The situation of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is a perilous one, and it has been made even more so by recent policies and actions taken by the US government.

These illegal activities often exploit vulnerable individuals and can result in serious harm or even death.

The root causes of this problem are complex and multifaceted, and addressing it will require a comprehensive and nuanced approach. Some possible solutions include:

    Improving conditions in the countries of origin: Many immigrants are driven to leave their home countries due to poverty, violence, and political instability. Addressing these root causes could help to reduce the flow of immigrants to the US-Mexico border.

    Providing more legal avenues for immigration: Increasing the number of visas and other legal pathways for immigration could help to reduce the demand for illegal means of crossing the border.

    Implementing humane and effective immigration policies: Policies that are humane, fair, and effective could help to reduce the suffering and exploitation of immigrants, as well as the negative impacts on both the US and Mexico.

      Enhancing international cooperation: Working with Mexico and other countries in the region to address the root causes of immigration and improve regional security could be an important part of the solution.
Additionally, both countries could work together to improve border security and enforce immigration laws in a more humane and effective manner.",Maybe
5,1,Utkarsh Singh,"Glorifying the elements of bondage doesn’t make the fact that subjugation still exists disappear. The same is the case with actively glorifying and ennobling domestic activities.  Feminism started as a movement to end the misogyny of the patriarchal society by putting an end to unfair sexism and bringing equity within the paradigm of men and women, not to solidify the pre-existing order.

Now, I by no means claim that domestic activities such as cleaning and cooking hold any less value than white-collar jobs and jobs such as farming and paid labor, which is responsible for running the world.  In fact, for centuries domestic work has been seen as an important task, since not only does it help in creating a sense of belongingness and cooperation which helps in the healthy functioning of society, but also helps in retaining mental peace throughout the world. The last thing anyone would wish is to come back to a rotting nest of a scattered mess after a day of hard work, let alone spend their nights there.

It is just a fact that one of the major issues that feminists have to tackle is making fellow women realize that a life outside domestic work exists. Patriarchy has always marginalized women through dogmatism and prejudice. This was done by limiting women to ‘feminine’ jobs which basically translates to domestic work. By actively reclaiming domestic jobs and glorifying them, we may be promoting something we despised. 

It is definitely true that with the rise of ‘woke’ culture and radical feminism in the west, grounding down seems a positive idea but we must not forget the reason all of this started. Not to facilitate the gibberish minority but to empower the masses of women who still are forced to live under constant misconduct and tyranny forced upon them by the still dominant patriarchal society.


","Would you like to see people casually playing football between borders on a Sunday afternoon? Care to buy and burn a few stashes of weed all the while watching fellow citizens hopping over the fences? On good days you may find Youtubers trying to do the same as an adventure sport, on bad days smell of blood isn’t too rare. Welcome to the US-Mexico Border. Where hope is the catalyst, and suffering is the outcome.

In layman’s language, this all can be described as an amplified rattrap. Helpless marginalized families of Mexico in desperate need of bread and shelter illegally hopping over borders like rats just to realize the ‘American Dream’ only to get trapped in an endless loop of oppression and tyranny inflicted on them by fellow humans who are ‘legally’ obliged to do so. The worsening condition of Mexico accompanied by the lucrative opportunities of creating a new future in America has led millions into this trap. Some found their way back, most got destroyed. 

We may have been born as citizens of this World but get confined within boundaries Not everyone understands them, such are the people living amidst this perilous crisis. The life of such folks starts and ends with violence and suffering. With the increasing rates of such immigration and the terrorizing dealing of the same by the American government, life has become even more vicious in this hell of a place. With nothing to lose or gain, resorting to illegal activities doesn’t seem a bad idea. The rise of human trafficking, drug deals, and criminal agencies rebelling at the borders for the rights that never belonged to them in the true sense accentuates the need for some action. Killing and locking won’t do it anymore. If this isn’t stopped then both countries not only going to lose financially through the loss of labor and taxes from Mexico but also the competition between the resources in the US.

With that said, Without understanding and addressing the key drivers of migration in the region the U.S. goal of a safe, secure, humane immigration operation at the border will remain elusive. This is not just an issue for Mexico, but also for the US. Regional cooperation is the key to negotiations here. You cannot clap with one hand. Funds are needed to bring back those who want to go back to their motherland and legal citizenship for certain sections that fulfill the criteria for the same. We as citizens of this world must act together to solve this crisis, before a war breaks and everyone loses.

Since regaining control, the Taliban have taken actions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the late 1990
The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities 
The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down
Women have seen their rights obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working. 
There is also an increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male chaperone and to completely cover their bodies. The rates of child marriage have also increased. 
Apart from that, More than 90 percent of the population has been suffering from some form of food insecurity. They also support terrorist organizations, particularly al-Qaeda, posing a threat to regional and international security.
Seeing all the above reason UN should not recognise the eslamic Emirates of Taliban as it will be totally against the humanitarian culture

5,1,Hartej Veer Singh Kochar ,"Feminism, as a movement, seeks to promote the rights and equality of women. I feel that one way how feminists can work towards achieving such a society is by actively reclaiming domestic activities, such as gardening, cooking caring and nurturing, as empowering.
Traditionally too, these activities have been seen as the domain of women but have often been seen as inferior or less valuable than work outside of the home. This has resulted in society devaluing such work and perpetuating the use of gender roles that disadvantage women.
However, by actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists can challenge these traditional gender roles and showcase the value of this work.
First and foremost, these skills are extremely valuable in today's world where young people regardless of gender are moving out sooner in search of new opportunities in new cities. Hence the ability to maintain a home and cook good food quickly and efficiently are skills every bachelor sees value in and wants to learn. 
Tasks like cooking and gardening can also be extremely creative and fulfilling activities that allow women to take pride in their skills and accomplishments. Such skills are what make raw ingredients into soul-touching food and land into beautiful meadows. A man can do as much as to provide a family with a house, and a space to live. But such skills in women are what make a house into a home, where childhoods are spent and memories are made. Such skills provide a sense of connection to the natural world and a sense of nourishment and well-being to women. 
Furthermore, by reclaiming domestic activities as empowering, feminists can also challenge the notion that portrays these activities are inferior or lesser than other forms of work. This can help to shift societal attitudes and values and pave the way for greater equality and respect for women's contributions. After all, one's work is only as valuable as one believes and showcases it to be.
In conclusion, feminists should reclaim domestic activities as empowering in order to challenge traditional gender roles, recognize the value of this work, feel a sense of purpose and promote greater equality for women.","On 15th August 2021, The Taliban took control and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan after the US finally withdrew from the region. Now the world must make a choice; to recognize 'terrorists' as a legitimate government or to leave the nation and its people to rot by cutting any aid and imposing sanctions on the already crippled economy of the country. I believe the wise choice is to recognize the Taliban as the rulers of their nation and my arguments are as follows:

First off, I'm sure we agree that the Taliban are Afghans, and it is only fair for Afghans to be their own rulers and not a western superpower and its puppet government. The Taliban waged war only because they wanted to establish a regime of their own. They viewed the US and the Ghani government as foreigners trying to rule over the sovereign people of Afghanistan. All the Taliban wanted was a safe and sovereign land for their people, so to blame them for the so-called ""atrocities"" they did to protect their people is a very narrow-minded view of the conflict. 
Moreover, denying UN recognition means depriving an economically weak nation of much-needed aid. A nation whose development came to a standstill because of a foreign power interfering in local governance by waging war for 20 years. Add to that sanctions, and one can see how cutting off Afghanistan from the world and depriving it of funds is one of the reasons why the people are poor and starving. 
One can easily look at the economic potential Afghanistan holds, many owners of businesses in local 'Bazaars' have seen a growth in livelihood ever since the US left. People now feel safer leaving their homes to work and live and are not constantly worried about being killed amidst an ongoing conflict.
 
The UN should recognize the Taliban as the new defacto ruler of Afghanistan. Instead of denying recognition based on ""Human Rights Concerns"", it should instead realize that denying legitimacy is depriving the Afghani people of their human rights. Recognition would mean putting the nation on the world stage, open for trade and investment. Allowing the Taliban to rule means a much-needed span of stability in the power structure of the region; which will surely lead to more investment, economic growth and hence eradication of Hunger and poverty, the most fundamental of human rights.

3,0,Suhani Agarwal,"A few years ago, we saw the wave of feminism spread all over the world. Women were actively participating in this movement and were asking for equal rights as men. The movement demanded equal rights for women such as equal pay for the same amount of work as men do, and the right to education. It also focused on putting an end to sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression. Overall, feminist theories are not restricted to women’s issues, but also promote power-sharing, leadership, and collaborative work in order to establish respect and acceptance for diversity amongst all members of society. One of the things feminism focused on is to make people stop considering domestic activities as a female job to do. It asked for equal participation of both sexes in household chores instead of just leaving the job to the women. Eventually, over the years, we saw a change in men's attitudes towards household labour. . Yes there was a change in society’s perspective on this old-age practice of considering household chores a female task but some people misunderstood the purpose. Instead of creating equality in domestic work, people especially young teenage girls took this as a way of escaping from household work. Females nowadays are reluctant to do household work. They think that society expects them to engage in household work, rather what it expects is equal participation. Feminism is never aimed at putting women in a position higher than men, rather providing equal opportunities and rights just as men. Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as gardening, cooking) as empowering.""

From cooking, cleaning to fetching water, taking care of the children and eldery, women work hard every day, and these are not easy tasks to perform.
In the patriarchal society, where women are still fighting to be recognized, it becomes extremely important to empower our women and the work they do. We must never forget where we've come from, our roots, how we've grown, and the crucial role women play in our society.
Also, the society that still dominates over women and is seen as a weaker section of the society, incapable of responsibilities and duties, it must be reminded that domestic work is not as easy task to perform, and they deserve as much respect as any working man does.
Domestic activities are not just cooking and cleaning, but they include taking care of the entire family, taking care of their health and needs, and play the most important part in the growth of the members of the family.
Therefore, any work deserves respect and domestic work must be recognized, how important it is for the growth of the entire family, and it is empowering and will always remain empowering.","One of the most important duties of the United Nations is to protect human rights and maintain peace and security.

The takeover of power by Taliban have deprived the citizens of their basic rights, a series of restrictions on women and extreme difficult situations for the people of Afghanistan. 
The condition in Afghanistan now under the rule of Talibans is miserable. With 43% of the population living on less than one meal a day and 97% expected to be living below poverty line, the situation is only degrading. 
It's extremely difficult for Afghans to make a living, earn money and feed their families.
Women, their lives been completely distorted, with thousands of restrictions and fright to step out of their homes, the condition is horrible.
The Talibans did say that they will let women work and will let the media critize them, but on the ground level there's onlh restrictions, terror and dread in the people of Afghanistan. 
The UN, world's only truly universal global organization, making it a very powerful organization and if recognized by the UN, the Islamic Emirate of Talibans, will only lead to societal degradation, deprivation of human rights, dominance over women, depriving women of their right to education, to work with other basic rights, and increase in hooligangs, poverty, food shortage and all the basic things any human being deserves.
The UN must work to at least ease down the difficulties faced by the Afghans daily and recognization in any form will lead then to power of making the people of Afghanistan more miserable.

According to me,an assertive female always has the right to choose,about what she wants to pursue. Concluding with not choosing any of the sides, I would like to enhance the idea of feminism by presenting mine which is freedom of thought, expression and work.","No! No such governance should ever be accepted if it hampers the harmony and integral integrity of a country and its people. The new rules have affected the population a lot, especially females.

3,0,Anurag,"I think it will be correct to say that feminists need to reclaim domestic activities
as empowering because by just focusing on increasing female representation in the male dominated sectors the point which is getting highlighted is that those male dominated sectors are superior to the ones which are dominated by females.
In addition to it, because of this mindset of feminists a general trend is seen all over the media in which
females are demeaned for doing domestic activities like gardening, cooking, general household chores.
On social media we can see males taking sly on females by ending the discussions with statements like ""Go and wash utensils first"" etc.
So basically the point here is instead of fighting for equality in different male 
dominated sectors, feminists and we should work to uplift the status of these female dominated sectors.
First step in the ladder of equality will be made only when the society will recognize these domestic activities of females and will stop using them as a tool to insult women.  Instead of giving society the impression that how eagerly they want to work in male dominated sectors all the feminists should reclaim the domestic work to empower themselves.","I need to have a proper research on the above topics before commenting anything on them.

5,1,Panshul Agarwal,"Domestic activities have been portrayed as stereotypical for so long that it has created an agenda to fight upon when it's not even remotely needed. One doesn't have to be a specific gender to enjoy doing something they like. The so called self proclaimed rules of the society that Men don't have to contribute to household work whereas its the women's responsibility to do so is very backward and in some sense derogatory to the idea of equality as a whole, but doing any activity which helps your your loved ones and the society should automatically be very empowering to the person,  no matter who, as it makes a difference to the world around them. Maybe it's not life changing , these small everyday task, but small things matter in the bigger picture. When people think about domestic chores they see it as a burden and are somewhat forced to do them under the societal pressure. But once they  to do them just for themselves it will feel very empowering .Self appreciation is an art much less people know lest practice it. Often Women get frustrated when they're being taken for granted about the domestic activities and not being acknowledged or appreciated for them. You don't need anyone's approval or acknowledgement when you have your own and feel empowered emotionally and physically about it. This doesn't mean they should be continued to be presumed that it's their ""Job"" to be indulge in domestic activities. An open mindset and approach to this issue will help the society as a whole and will lead to a better future","Heartbreaking. One single word to define the struggles of those thousands of children, forced to flee their home, forced to leave behind everything. Shattering, to see the women who came to find a new life, a new start to everything, assaulted in the border towns and refuting to illegal methods like crossing the river. The whole situation of Mexicans immigration has had a deep impact on people of both the states. One of the world's most lethal land borders has not only left people without a roof on their head but has taken so many lives due to the limits the desperate people go to cross the border. Why? Its simple. Most of the immigrants are either from Mexico, Haiti ,El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. These countries simply don't have enough opportunities and resources to give their people a healthy and successful lifestyle. High crime rates, low per capita income and poor quality of life frustrate and scare the people for their futures So They turn to their closest, well developed neighbor for a livelihood to sustain but get caught in the trap of bureaucracy of the US administration. Over 3 terms, they've tried to solve this issue via various policies and regulations but none of them have worked efficiently for both parties till now. Like everything, mass immigration has its pros and cons for all the parties involved. For central American countries, it means an opportunity for them to grow their economy. But also means the increased crime rates in many border towns and poverty amongst people. For the United States, a new mass of people means competition for jobs and it affect the quality of life as a whole because of exposure to new people. Smuggling has increased tenfold due to illegal immigration as smugglers try to take advantage of desperate people and have no value for their lives.
Trump administration decided to build the border wall to completely stop the movement but it posed a lot of problems. 
Biden administration used the USBP to arrest the people which was felt to be inhumane but a lot of the public.
Overall, This problem poses a threat to a lot of people and needs to be sorted quickly. Bilateral talks and a relaxation on granting asylum will certainly help all the parties. 
Sorting this out should be priority to for all before a disastrous outcome.

5,1,Shikhar Singh ,"If our aforementioned topic is accepted in our society then I think it would help a lot in the evergoing argument of ""gender equality and
how it can be implemented"", therefore I am in the favour of the motion ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities (such as
gardening, cooking) as empowering""
In this era of modernization, domestic activities are considered devalued at first glance, but if one would look into its effects
on every person's life every day, one would come to realize how impactful it is. Impacts such as helping out in keeping good mental health
and being a constant in such a challenging world for the working class.
Now one would come and ask why only women should be doing this and my response is first of all this is not just reserved for the female section, it can be done by both men and women. But since it has been a stronghold for women, abandoning this in favor of getting more rights is downright foolish.
If one were to change his/her lifestyle, he/she just doesn't change all of his/her outlook, activities, or peer group, the person seeks out gradual changes in the negative part of life and starts giving more in the correct direction. Similarly abandoning the ever-needed role of a domestic worker, feminists should work on how it can be more useful in their campaign.
The role of providing healthy, nutritious food over alternative junk and street food and lush green gardens in this polluted environment is quite a positive point for domestic workers which majorly consist of female workers.
I think this is some of the many reasons I stand in favor of the motion.
","For avoiding further situations, ""the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban."" The whole revolution started during the Afghan Civil War led by students who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools. Handing over to them a whole country might as well lead to the start of a cult-led country with a lot of problems with uneducated and backward thoughts. This whole debacle started due to the radical followers of traditional Islam.

The whole world has been thinking about how to figure out and erase discrimination of all kinds but supporting the Taliban will be a major setback for the whole campaign. We have quite good examples of this whole disastrous process such as China and North Korea. We all are very well acquainted with the life-endangering crises created by these countries.

Of course, the number of massacres conducted by the Taliban is a major negative point for which they should not be given the recognition by UN.

These are some of the major reasons why the UN should not recognize the Islamic Emirate Of Taliban.

5,1,Yashita Singh,"It is evident that the wave of feminism flowing today is the most evocative it has ever been. This celebrated era has welcomed women constantly reaching new heights, overcoming substantial stigmas. Amidst this a much-neglected domain is the domestic, essentially as a powerhouse. 

We're obviously afar from the cultural “ethics” where women toil, shackled to a four-walled boundary, constantly slaving and serving. Today’s world upholds independence and self-reliance as virtues of undeniable importance. Cooking, cleaning, gardening, etc. remain as the elementary skills of survival. Moreover, the entirety of feminism was to not dictate what is and what isn’t allowed irrespective their sex. If a woman, a self-reliant independent woman, wants to stay at home, make a living out of it or even be a homemaker, it should be her choice. 

People today are misled by something that has surfaced as a byproduct of feminism, or rather pseudo-feminism. The whole debate of women not doing any household work because they are suppressed doing so, is illogical. A woman could be a CEO or a minimum wage worker but at the end she has to fill her stomach and have a clean home. They need the skill to support at least themselves, if not any families. These skills are not in any way or form derogatory. Reclaiming them, if they wish to do so, could also empower women by providing a stable source of income- an extremely essential asset in today's ever-changing economy. 
A woman A has no money, goes and works as a domestic help, a cook, sells house plants or garments, whatever she can concoct, feeds her family and becomes a hero to them. 

There exists an enormity of women who relish cooking for herself and her dearly. There exist women who love to raise children, dream of their own rose garden. Empowering their will, is empowering the women, and empowering the women is the purpose of feminism. 
However, these women are made to seem unfit by the pseudo-feminist ideals. The true essence of empowerment lies in the freedom these women have. A strong, empowered woman is the sole elector of her job and consequently she claims her reputable status and dignity in the society, and a true feminist only then slumbers a good night’s sleep. 
","It's when a striking amount of time has passed since rifle-toting Taliban fighters once again wreaked havoc on the Afghan capital and cemented their take over. The load of human rights violated by their unsupervised atrocities would bury Amnesty's officers in heaps of paperwork. As the Taliban entered Kabul on August 15, thousands of people tried to flee the country, but chaos and violence at the airport impeded the evacuation of many at-risk Afghans. The Taliban victory propelled Afghanistan from humanitarian crisis to complete catastrophe. Afghanistan in its condition could gain from the recognition the UN would provide. With governmental recognition, the state can exercise its international law rights and may be held legally responsible for the government’s actions even after the government is replaced. Government recognition does not require normalization of relations, establishment of diplomatic relations, or a moral/political endorsement of the government while subjecting them to negotiations over recognition, subject to the Taliban meeting favored conditions, using recognition as a carrot to urge the Taliban to undertake the necessary fundamental reforms. Fulfilling its counter-terrorism obligations, a Taliban government would have to comply with its obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law. To pretend that the de facto government does not exist where it is obviously exercising authority would simply liberate the miscreant of its international obligations and responsibilities.",False
5,1,Apoorva Kumari,"Yes, I think feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowerment. Domestic work like cooking, cleaning, and gardening has always been looked down upon as something which is inferior and only done by people who are not independent or self-sufficient. A large section of women in India and across the globe are engaged in different forms of domestic activities and hence it becomes even more important that domestic work gets recognized as something which is empowering.
Homemakers and housewives who constitute a large fraction of our population are made to look at their duties and situations as a homemaker as it is something that was holding them back from ‘real power’ by the modern feminists. However, I think those feminists are wrong. Women already have power. They have the power to provide for their families, take care of them by nurturing them with real home-cooked foods, and heal them when they became ill. They are producers rather than just mindless consumers. They work with their partners to create good lives and healthy families and their contributions are every bit as valuable as men’s.
I think as long as domestic work and homemaking do not get recognized as something which is empowering, it is impossible for us to achieve equality of all sexes which is the basic idea of feminism. We need to start recognizing and encouraging domesticity because it is smart and empowering. Domestic work is a powerful life choice that makes one more self-sufficient and in control of their finances and future.
And hence, I think it is very important for modern feminists to reclaim and recognize domestic work as something which is empowering and as valuable as going out and earning. ","There is a real crisis at the border right now. It is a humanitarian crisis, not a security threat. It is something that the U.S. government is perfectly capable of administering. But it is still a crisis. It is taking a toll on migrant families, overworked Border Patrol agents, overwhelmed judges, and humanitarian aid workers. People are coming for several reasons like violence, insecurity, poverty, lack of economic opportunity, etc. A few solutions to this problem could probably be having more courts and judges in a reformed asylum system, expand access to legal counsel, getting serious about alternatives to detention, especially family case management, revamping the ports of entry, etc. I think we should  recognize Mexico’s efforts to support Central American migrants and expand access to asylum. Both countries should also work together and with the UNHCR to ensure that a procedure is in place to support Central Americans at risk who deem that the United States is the most appropriate place for them to request asylum, either due to family ties, concerns about safety in Mexico, or other reasons. This is particularly the case for unaccompanied children who may qualify for asylum in Mexico but who have parents or other family members in the United States.",False
5,1,Gureen Juneja,"For the motion-
The ideology of feminism is more than empowering and uplifting women from the unjust they have to face on a daily basis. It also puts emphasis on the men of our society and advocates for their empowerment. They are associated with their wifely and motherly duties specially in a patriarchal society like India. More than 90% percent of the households are looked entirely by females. The female disproportionately bears the burden of the house where the only job of a man is considered to earn money. The real problem behind this is the choice that the female feel that they don’t have but in the recent times we have seen a shift in the mindsets of people, the acceptance that people are showing to gender equality after marriage specially in the households where both partners are working and they equally divide the work. Bollywood movies like Ki&Ka was a major shocker in the male dominated society. The movie depicted that just like a man works a female can do a 9 to 5 job and a man can look after the house and paa can also cook delicious food with the same amount of love and affection just like maa does. A major change in the mindset of people has been because of the globalisation as more females have started working with multinational corporates where they are made familiar with the western culture which promotes feminism in every possible way. Women are not encouraged and motivated who choose to work instead are expected to get married and have kids and look after the family should be her only goal. If we look around all the top designers like Manish Malhotra, Gaurav Gupta, Virgil Abloh and chefs like Sangeev Kapoor, Vikas Khanna etc are male and are inspiration to many of us but if we closely look at the field they are in are linked with women. Their success is a live example that domestic labour interlacing with sentimental value is link between female and domestic work only which indicated the notions made about the work based on gender.
","These southwestern states of the USA namely Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California share border with Mexico. These states are out under immense pressure and strain as many illegal immigrants try to cross border because of the lifestyle, fame and revenue that USA may provide to their family and themselves.

They are often not transferred through the Federal justice system because of the drugs that they are caught with. After they are taken in the custody the states have to bear expenses for the medical services, autopsy and burials that takes place which has imposed a huge financial strain. Under a study it was found that the two California states which are the poorest states carries the burden of approximately 50 million dollars. A huge amount of the army funds is also emphasized on border patrolling system. The immigrants are kept in detention centers where they are constantly tortured on a daily basis and beaten up. Many of the people have spent more than half of their lives in these detention centers. They are not only harassed physically but it also affects them mentally.

5,1,Maryam,"No. Household chores have never and mustn't ever be considered as activities of empowerment. These activities, within a family, should be mutually distributed between the spouses, as it equally contributes to their wellbeing. Women empowerment has ever been subjected to these stereotypes and the taboo's of the society, where it's expected of a woman to prioritize domestic activities over things that might truly benefit her. Women aren't given the freedom to manifest or explore the various opportunities there exist and yet will be expected  the same as men. Empowerment may not exist in the same way for everyone but its essence and meaning is the same for all, ie. the growth and self satisfaction of the indivisual. The practicality of the matter may be different than what the tenets underpin but for the general understanding, it is not rightful to accept this as an acitivity of empowerment. ","Recognising what? The gruesome and horrid takeover by taliban? The monarchs ruling over  and against innocent families just to estabilish their so called truth. The truth that calls for restriction of women's education, killing of innocent lives, worsening the standards of living, forcing their beliefs on others? 
All that has happened in Afghanistan and continues to happen is totally uncalled for and nothing that was welcomed by the people. If the people of a nation isn't acceptive of their regime, what meaning does it hold for others to give them the recognizance. Their ulterior motive is but to exercise their superiority, filthy & corrupted sensory of righteousness, which will never and hasn't ever brought any good to a nation. They have only increased Afghanistan in its poverty and ignorance. Rather than being recognised, they should be fought hard against to give back people their basic right to live and exist with a sense of relief and peace of mind.

5,1,Bhavya Tiwari ,"First of all, I believe that this very question comes from rooted misogyny. In my opinion, there is no strict need for feminists to actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering. Therefore, I stand against the motion. I believe an argument like this should not even be a point of discussion in times like today's where people are progressing towards a more equal society. The women that pride themselves because of the skills they have with respect to activities like gardening, cooking should pursue them because they have the skill and willingness to do so. Domestic work or work outside the house, under no circumstances, should be defined under columns like empowering and non-empowering. Work in all forms is work and deserves recognition. The idea that feminism is about making a woman believe that she should step out of the house in the corporate and industrial world to make a name for herself is just bizarre to me. A woman does not need to believe that working 9-5 in an office, wearing a suit and tie will make her feel empowered. A woman who has a small bakery business of her own, enjoys being a homemaker, or anything of such sorts, deserves to feel just as much empowered. One must choose for themselves what makes them feel empowered and we must not need external agencies to advocate that for us. Succumbing to a thought like this would only give rise to neosexism, proving that feminists should actively ""reclaim"" domestic activities as empowering, wherein it has been assumed that it was something they were generally good at, and presumably even better than men who were always a step ahead in the industrial world. Notions like these simply bring to light the still existing discrimination between the two sexes in the minds of people.","Afghanistan’s internal political turmoil has often been influenced by international forces and has in turn also given rise to much debate about self government and human rights. One such critical question is about official international recognition for the Taliban government. 
I believe that this question can be answered by comparing the nature of the previous Taliban regime and the current one that has been in place since the pulling out of US troops in 2021. The premise of a changed Taliban is based on a number of converging interests and developments. Chief among these are the military stalemate of the Afghan conflict and the United States’ rush to exit Afghanistan. The newfound negotiating skills of the group’s political office in Doha during the US-Taliban talks, their quick adaptation of tools like social media, drones, and other technological innovations to pursue their political and military ends, and finally, their media savvy spokespersons. It is worth noting that that the Taliban previously deemed all of these things un-Islamic during their reign in the 1990’s. Therefore, the time has come for the West and Afghans to stop thinking of the Taliban as international terrorists but rather view them as a nationalist politico-military group and embrace them. It is time to focus on helping the movement to adapt to being a conventional political player on the world stage, and to help them iron out their ideological flaws and rigid worldview through exposure and education.
Moreover, even amid debates about government recognition, our primary concern should be the state of human rights under the Taliban regime. The previous approach of non-recognition from the world(with the exception of select few countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) from 1996 to 2001 did not yield much progress on the human rights front. This time, the UN and the world must deploy a different strategy, one that could possible ease tensions with the Taliban government and encourage better human rights conditions for afghan citizens.",False
5,1,Arpit Bansal,"As we know feminism is considered to be equal rights for men and women. The word feminism is sometimes confused with giving more rights or making women superior to men in every aspect but no it's majorly means supporting women in every aspect where men are been introduced very well in society. Women should be empowered in our society so that they should come at an equal pace with men and should not feel alienated from society. As most of the women in rural India are engaged in farming, gardening,cooking and many activities but these activities are not paid and are considered to be less reputable in our society. But being a feminist we should reclaim the concept of empowerment by inculcating activities such as gardening, cooking as a very much part of our society as it contributes alot to our economy.
As we know every activity has an equal contribution to society but these activities lack pay scale in our society and women are not credited for that which does not give them a sense of empowerment. 
If we include activity such as house keeping, gardening, cooking, taking care of children as a very much part of work as men's do we can actually know the struggles women face as equal as to men who work under pressure in a company. Women indulge themselves into multiple tasking at home which makes them refine in their own skills. We can redefine the word empowerment and feminism by crediting women with every activity they engage in by little bit of appreciation and calculating their work as part of mainstream society.

46,0,Ritik Chauhan,"Feminism, a belief that has pulled the attention of entire world towards itself.
It's a belief that women should have equal rights as men. And this belief is rising exponentially across the globe. The people who fight for the equal rights for women are known as feminists. Feminists tend to promote women empowerment and try their best to make it look that women are not less capable than men in any aspect. This perspective sounds really nice when it's about making the women aware of their capabilities but nowadays feminism is not just lying in these textbook like context.
Feminists have started believing that domestic activities such as gardening, cooking are not just to be done my women but also by men as they are the works that are independent of gender of the doer. But it's not just where the conversation ends. They believe that these type of households when done by women make the women community look weaker than men and thus they tend to create a stereotype that these domestic activities should be avoided by women. Now this perspective seems very impractical when it comes to reality. Men and women, both have the rights to choose their occupation as per their own interests. Men can cook and women can do a 9-5 job, it just depends on the interests of individuals what they like to pursue. Occupations should not be related to gender because when it comes to productivity then gender plays no role there as men and women both are capable of giving the same productivity. And when it comes to domestic activities, feminists should not see it as a stereotype that will rise a concern to their belief.

5,1,Ayushman Bari,"""Feminism isn't about making women stronger. Women are already strong, it's about changing the way the world perceives that strength.""

The famous quote of G.D. Anderson clearly proclaims and signifies how strong womens are , as they themselves do soo many work still they got to listen soo many disheartening things. These all are soo heart breaking on seeing such an awesome and strong soul to get these kinds of comments. We must and we should support women empowerment in every form, as this is least we can do for them. Women's empowerment may be defined in several ways, including accepting women's viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, and training. Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make life-determining decisions through the different societal problems.They may have the opportunity to re-define gender roles or other such roles, which allow them more freedom to pursue desired goals. Women's empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics. Economic empowerment allows women to control and benefit from resources, assets, and income. It also aids the ability to manage risk and improve women's well-being. It can result in approaches to support trivialized genders in a particular political or social context. While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of gender empowerment concerns people of any gender, stressing the distinction between biological and gender as a role. Women empowerment helps boost women's status through literacy, education, training and awareness creation.Furthermore, women's empowerment refers to women's ability to make strategic life choices that were previously denied them. They must acquire empowerment rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Empowerment and disempowerment are relative to each other at a previous time, empowerment is a process rather than a product.","Migration into the United States through the Mexico-US border started to surge in late 2020, reaching a record number of 1.73 million migrant encounters in 2021 with more expected in 2022 controversial.

Another century comes and still, here we are, all stuck on the fact that women are not given equal opportunities. People may come and talk about it every day but there are only few who actually make an effort when it comes to making a difference. Feminism is all about advocating for equal rights in the society and changing people's presumption of work and pay being divided based on gender. Feminism teaches us that people should be given equal opportunities and that they should be free to explore without any restrictions based on gender. This is also the concept behind empowering people wherein they have the authority or power to make their own life decisions and are stronger and more confident in their skin and claiming their rights. That being said, what mainly empowers people is that they perform all their tasks by themselves, without being dependent on others and without waiting for permission from other people. This includes that they develop an overall personality and acquire all the basic skills that a human being needs to survive. Domestic activities such as gardening, cooking, cleaning, etc. are basic human activities which each person needs to learn and perform, to become independent and confident in themselves. Be it a child or a grown adult, a working professional or a business person, a man or a woman, performing domestic activities is something which every person is obligated to do for themselves. It is a duty and a promise to themselves rather than to others. I feel that women in general are taught to do domestic activities from an early stage and are just expected to perform these duties throughout their life as an obligation towards their families. At first, feminists all over the world saw this as a burden on women that restricts their freedom and forces them to be bound by family duties and hence feminists shunned this concept. But as we see changes and reforms in modern society wherein mothers teach their children, regardless of their gender, basic cooking, cleaning, gardening, etc. this comes across as an act of overall personality development of kids starting from an early stage. This also prepares future generations to be ready to face the world with confidence, be independent and also teaches them to be respectful of everyone around them. So I feel that people especially feminists all across the world should actively accept this concept for the betterment of all. 
","We all are well aware of the recent annexation of Afghanistan by the Taliban and its aftermath. Taliban have a very well-known history and their recent movements and attacks have been criticised and published massively all across the world. People have had many discussions and debates over their righteousness and some have even questioned them on humanitarian and moral grounds. UN being one of the most prestigious intergovernmental organisations which aims at promoting peace and cooperation among all has openly condemned the actions of the Taliban and had many conferences about the same. Taliban recently introduced several reforms in Afghanistan in social and political spheres such as the prevention of secondary education for girls, restriction of women from entering public places and confining them to their homes, etc. This has affected not only the people of Afghanistan but also people from across the world and has got many women human rights defenders peacefully protesting against growing restrictions and many international organisations questioning their wrongdoings. International leaders and the community, in general, have been voicing their opinions on the same and are demanding basic human rights for all. In my opinion, the UN should not recognise the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban because it will serve as a validation of their wrongdoings and also serves as a denial of people's rights. This will give rise to discrimination and injustice against people all over the world and hamper world peace and cooperation. UN sole purpose is to maintain harmony amongst all and giving a recognition to them destroys this purpose.",False

When a person starts getting paid for the same work then it is considered as ‘WORK ‘ .Self worth of homemakers has deprived and there is immediate requirement to boost the self esteem of women especially the homemakers who should be given equal credit and respect as working women as this will lead to a brighter future without any gender bias.","For decades, Afghanistan has been a country which saw civil wars and violence for holding of power .Taliban has recently took over power in Afghanistan and now is imposing its own rules and regulations on the country .

5,1,Yashi Pitti,"Traditionally, the responsibilities of domestic work has been considered as a woman's domain. But since it does not generate income,  the efforts of women are considered trivial and remain unvalued. But it is important to recognize and admire the labor done to complete these tasks, to instill a sense of empowerment and to save the women, not involved in monetized work, from the belittling they face.

While, where activities like cooking, gardening, cleaning have a monetary value associated, the men dominate the workforce. And this is ingrained in the minds of the masses that household work is a woman's niche. But such an ideology has and will continue to have serious repercussions on the lives of women. Such mindset of the society leaves the woman bereft of power to take decisions for herself, let alone her welfare. Thus working women cannot really exercise control of their own time, because they are burdened with duties of household, catering to children, family along with office work. Thus , posing the issue of time-poverty for women.
On the contrary, men enjoy the freedom to decide the course of their day. They also have an upperhand, when setting the family budget or having any discussion in general. They also have the societal privilege to instruct the women according to their own needs or wants. 

It is time to break these conventions and move ahead, change notions developed over centuries, restricting and hindering women's development and growth. Feminists and other people with like opinions on the subject of domestic work, together should stand up and refute these societal norms and pre conceived notions. The belief that ""Domestic work is entitled to women"", shall be changed with feminists actively reclaiming domestic activities as empowering. This will allow for load sharing and not sexist division of work.

With broad and open mindedness, more men will be encouraged to take up domestic chores like cooking, washing clothes, etc. Women will get the flexibility to work outside of their homes, according to their own schedules. And since they'll be free of the household worries and constraints, they can focus on more important  things like taking the right steps to move ahead in their careers and achieving milestones. It will also provide women with leisure time to discover new hobbies and pursue their interests.
","The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan caused a massive upheaval in the country. With the withdrawal of US troops from the state and absconding of Ashraf Ghani , the then Afghan president, the taliban fighters ramped up attacks and seized territories, eventually gaining control of the Kabul, the capital. And between all of this, it was the civilians who bore the brunt with a large number being killed and injured in firings and assaults.

The state of governance was in complete disorder. With much of the population looking to escape the country and settle where their lives weren't threatened. The afghan economy took a huge plunge and contracted significantly. The taliban takeover meant enforcement of the sharia law and the country's vision being set by a group of people who's only aim was to get back in power (after being ousted in 2001) through all means however ruthless and devastating.

Under the Taliban, Afghanistan faced a humanitarian crisis. The taliban rule posed a threat to human rights. Anyone who violated Taliban laws faced severe punishment. They mistreated women and imposed several restrictions for not acting in accordance of the discriminatory policies. Women were ordered to wear burqa at all times in public. It was necessary for a male guardian to accompany them every time they move out of homes. Also women reporters were asked to cover up their faces on air. Segregated classrooms were set up in schools that followed Islamic Standards and recently in dec 2022, women were barred from attending university classes. So , women who were already facing discrimination before Taliban takeover, are devoid of even fundamental human rights.

The Taliban's repressive regime has serious repercussions affecting the country's development and welfare. Several countries cut ties with the nation after the Taliban infiltration and suspended aids, that Afghanistan was dependent on. Thus, economic situation of the country worsened. Many people lost jobs and livelihoods, poverty and hunger worsened. The country with unstable finances faced famine like situations, not being able to provide adequate food. The quality of living deteriorated and security compromised. 

UN shall not give recognition to a state that is so regressive and revolting. With such an inefficient Taliban regime , it cannot be foreseen if the country will develop even in future. The Taliban is an ultraconservative political and religious faction.
Also the Taliban's close relation with Al-Qaeda, a terrorist group raises concerns that Afghanistan shall become a breeding ground and a shelter for terrorism. Thus, recognizing the Islamic State of Taliban signifies a support for terrorism . This is clearly against the purposes and principles of UN like maintaining international peace and security, promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights.

Since the Taliban Govt is not formed in people's interest, and has caused a turmoil in the country, with many crimes it committed to humanity, and poor handling of the finance and non cooperation with the citizens, it shall not be recognised as The Islamic Emirate of Taliban.",False

We need to understand no work is bigger or smaller and we need to realise that for the proper functioning of our country currently. A huge number of cooks, gardeners and many such other jobs are a big part of our society. We would not be able to function in our day to day life without their help. I understand that in our materialistic world earning money and having a job at a higher position is only way to get freedom in true sense.But for these we cannot ignore all the other tasks that help us in day to day. For example for us college kids we should perform these activities as it will benefit us so much in future. We should not forget that many of our mothers are house wives and what we are today are highly because of them and they must be respected and empowered. So, I believe its high time that we let go old habits and establish a new society which not only accepts these jobs but also considered as empowering and respecting jobs. ","Taliban is a predominantly Pashtun, Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 after waging a twenty-year insurgency. 
Following the U.S led invasion that toppled the original regime in 2001, the Taliban regrouped across the border in Pakistan and began taking back territory less than ten years after their ouster. By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. 
I think the UN should not recognise the taliban as they have imposed several harsh interpretations of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and minority communities and provide amnesty for people who supported U.S. efforts. Meanwhile, as they have transitioned from an insurgent group to a functional government, the Taliban have struggled to provide Afghans with security, adequate food, and economic opportunities.
This threatens the basic right of citizens and with the reminiscent of their brutal rule .The Taliban have intimidated journalists and restricted press freedoms, leading dozens of news organizations to shut down. Protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared. All of this is strongly against our basic right of freedom of speech.
Taliban also reestablished their Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which under previous Taliban rule enforced prohibitions on behavior deemed un-Islamic. 
Women have seen their rights obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school and prevented women across the country from working. Amnesty International reports a drastic increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male chaperone and to completely cover their bodies. The rates of child marriage have also increased.

well, the main purpose is to change the notion of the society, if we can make the people believe that the domestic activities are no less masculine then the people will believe that both the male and female dominated work can be viewed equally among all. further it will ensure that women also look at the male dominated sectors as something they could also achieve. because once we get the respect for the occupation we do, it creates a sense of security in our mind and helps us to look at rest of the world, othervise we tend to get prejudiced. so feminism should actively promote the domestic activites becouse there is no limit to what women can accomplish. also by endulging in in domestic activities they can assist there families financially, further contributing to the economy. which will also further be a step ahead to men accepting themselves in feminine roles.","well the united nations have enough reasons and evidences to deny the living of the taliban. the organisation launched a scathing attack once the US started to retreat the forces from the afghanistan 15 years after they entered there in search of osama bin laden. the taliban has infringed the women rights and havent allowed them the moral rights. the women are not given enough liberty and they havent been allowed enough participation. not only UN even the ICC cricket body has come out in support and claimed that they will disrecognise afghanistan if they dont create a womens team, this marks a huge step towards bringing bakc normality in afghanistan. therefore i personally believe that the UN should not recognise the talibans. more should be first done towards bringing back normality, creating a safe and secure ecosystem in the country. once there is abundance of peace out there, then even UN might try to support talibans. bcoz ultimately the main aim of the body is to ensure there is world peace maintained.",False
5,1,Pranav Singh Kanwar,"I stand in support with this motion. I feel that domestic activities like cooking and gardening are often sidelined by feminists as being typical to a patriarchic societies boundations set on women. This negatively affects the outlook of society in general making women feel like their doing cooking/gardening is a sign of their submissiveness and might kill the passion that woman might have discovered in that field. In India we often see this narrow set of career options being set on the youth, simply because of the negative societal overlook of other fields such as fine arts, dramatics, etc all of which eventually leads to the creation of a factory of socially acceptable engineers, doctors, etc simply doing their jobs without any sense of passion. Feminists often see empowering roles for women as engineers, pilots, actresses but always sideline and negate the fields like cooking and gardening simply because they are in a way linked to the old age perception of women in general. Also, doing household chores is never a demeaning thing for a woman just like it isn't for a man. Household work has to be managed and distributed by all family members to make the house to a place which you can call home. By villifying such activities women in general tend to develop an apathy towards such chores, and then it may lead to arguments with their male family members like their fathers, or husbands because of the lack of distribution of household work, all of which takes a toll on the mental health and stability of society as a whole.","No, I firmly believe that the Islamic Emirate of Taliban should not be recognised by the UN. I feel that the steps taken by the group to govern the country fall acutely insufficient to satisfy the needs of the nation. The group's rank and file consists mainly of little to completely uneducated young trigger-happy men, whose presence does not instill any sense of safety. If such people were to be part of the government then, even highly educated diplomats would fear while dispensing their responsibilities. Also, the group is well known fo having an archaic mindset when it comes to women's rights and education. A country cannot truly prosper without the active participation of women and in an environment where women don't feel safe while venturing out they'd never be able to actively contribute to the society. A UN recognition to this group's governance of the country would undo the years of struggles by feminists in getting basic rights for women as then Afghanistan would become an example for other neighboring countries seeking to oppress women, and would begin a snowball effect. Despite all claims made by the group, many independent agencies have also seen an increase in the overall oppression on minorities and injustice served out to them. Many places of religious importance to minorities have been ransacked in broad daylight, women have been harassed, people have been displaced.

Segregating tasks on the basis of genders will sow seeds of division and create imbalance which would finally hinder us from developing as a nation. A person who is well rounded is more empowered as compared to a person who is not well rounded( considering life skills) , be it a man or a woman. Also tasks like gardening and cooking shouldnt be shamed or looked down on as it would only increase the stigma around such activities which would deter people from taken them up.

Barring women from educational institutions and public life is not the most logical and progressive decision for a nation to make, if its aim is to develop. Well if taliban’s aim isnt to develop then that would have its own consequences as the Afghan public will start to rebel for better living conditions thereby leading to collapse, its just a matter of time. UN in this situation would have made it easier for the afghan people, but now thats not the case , its the afghan people that suffer , which is a humanitarian issue.

Glorifying the elements of bondage doesn’t make the fact that subjugation still exists disappear. The same is the case with actively glorifying and ennobling domestic activities.  Feminism started as a movement to end the misogyny of the patriarchal society by putting an end to unfair sexism and bringing equity within the paradigm of men and women, not to solidify the pre-existing order.

Now, I by no means claim that domestic activities such as cleaning and cooking hold any less value than white-collar jobs and jobs such as farming and paid labor, which is responsible for running the world.  In fact, for centuries domestic work has been seen as an important task, since not only does it help in creating a sense of belongingness and cooperation which helps in the healthy functioning of society, but also helps in retaining mental peace throughout the world. The last thing anyone would wish is to come back to a rotting nest of a scattered mess after a day of hard work, let alone spend their nights there.

It is just a fact that one of the major issues that feminists have to tackle is making fellow women realize that a life outside domestic work exists. Patriarchy has always marginalized women through dogmatism and prejudice. This was done by limiting women to ‘feminine’ jobs which basically translates to domestic work. By actively reclaiming domestic jobs and glorifying them, we may be promoting something we despised. 

It is definitely true that with the rise of ‘woke’ culture and radical feminism in the west, grounding down seems a positive idea but we must not forget the reason all of this started. Not to facilitate the gibberish minority but to empower the masses of women who still are forced to live under constant misconduct and tyranny forced upon them by the still dominant patriarchal society.



","Would you like to see people casually playing football between borders on a Sunday afternoon? Care to buy and burn a few stashes of weed all the while watching fellow citizens hopping over the fences? On good days you may find Youtubers trying to do the same as an adventure sport, on bad days smell of blood isn’t too rare. Welcome to the US-Mexico Border. Where hope is the catalyst, and suffering is the outcome.

In layman’s language, this all can be described as an amplified rattrap. Helpless marginalized families of Mexico in desperate need of bread and shelter illegally hopping over borders like rats just to realize the ‘American Dream’ only to get trapped in an endless loop of oppression and tyranny inflicted on them by fellow humans who are ‘legally’ obliged to do so. The worsening condition of Mexico accompanied by the lucrative opportunities of creating a new future in America has led millions into this trap. Some found their way back, most got destroyed. 

We may have been born as citizens of this World but get confined within boundaries Not everyone understands them, such are the people living amidst this perilous crisis. The life of such folks starts and ends with violence and suffering. With the increasing rates of such immigration and the terrorizing dealing of the same by the American government, life has become even more vicious in this hell of a place. With nothing to lose or gain, resorting to illegal activities doesn’t seem a bad idea. The rise of human trafficking, drug deals, and criminal agencies rebelling at the borders for the rights that never belonged to them in the true sense accentuates the need for some action. Killing and locking won’t do it anymore. If this isn’t stopped then both countries not only going to lose financially through the loss of labor and taxes from Mexico but also the competition between the resources in the US.

With that said, Without understanding and addressing the key drivers of migration in the region the U.S. goal of a safe, secure, humane immigration operation at the border will remain elusive. This is not just an issue for Mexico, but also for the US. Regional cooperation is the key to negotiations here. You cannot clap with one hand. Funds are needed to bring back those who want to go back to their motherland and legal citizenship for certain sections that fulfill the criteria for the same. We as citizens of this world must act together to solve this crisis, before a war breaks and everyone loses.

5,1,Pratham Pratap Bhalotia ,"Yes, I firmly believe that feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities ( such as gardening, and cooking) as empowering. Domestic work is seen as women’s work. Domestic activities are part of one of the most gendered career field around the globe. Domestic work is something that in many parts of the globe is looked down upon and many people are shy to admit that they are domestic workers. But should they? No, they are very important for the society. Because, they do not serve the present requirement of society, they also play a very important role in the future of society as the future generation is constantly under their guidance right from birth. Domestic workers include our or someone’s mother, sisters, daughters etc. One of the biggest reasons, why domestic work is looked down is that many around the globe believe that domestic work requires no skill. People believe that those working a corporate job etc possess skill. But, those who believe that domestic work requires no skill, should be reminded that domestic workers provide us with healthy food, clean our clothes, clean our home, take care of our health, look after us when we are sick etc. Does anyone want to return home after an exhausting day and then cook a meal, clean clothes etc. No, right? In my opinion, feminists should work to create awareness regarding the importance of domestic activities and domestic workers. How their presence has made our life easier and less hectic. At last, I would like to add that currently I am living in a hostel and this is my first time away from home. Now, I clearly realize my mother’s, and sisters’ importance .Because of them, I could return to a clean and tidy home, all my clothes taken care and freshly cooked food would be served. But, since I have shifted to a hostel I have to do all the above activities myself, as a result of which I am left with very little  leisure time.","No, I strongly believe that the UN should refrain from recognizing the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban.
Any government’s priority should be to serve its people’s interests like providing them with food, security, financial stability of the nation, etc.
But this newly formed government has failed miserably. Failure would be acceptable ( considering inexperience) only if they tried, but it seems that they have other intentions. Intentions to harshly interpret Islamic laws to violate women's rights and support terrorist organizations. Something very similar to their ambitions before being overthrown in 2001 by the US-led forces.
After coming into power, after the American troops were withdrawn from Afghan soil, promises were made. But the question is have they stood or even tried to stand by their commitments? Has there been any improvement in the state under the Taliban? The answer is no. No, there has been no improvement and no attempt to stand by their promises.
The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented numerous human right violation.
Something which the world would consider a crime against women's rights has increased exponentially. Moreover, Women's rights to education have been prohibited. Besides having to appear in public with fully covering their bodies with a male chaperone, rates of child marriage have also increased significantly.
The living standards of Afghans which had improved in two decades have started to decrease. As per reports, it is believed that soon all Afghans will live in poverty.
But this is not it. It seems that Afghanistan has become a safe shelter for terrorist groups, especially Al-Qaeda. This was proved after the US drowning attack which killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in August 2022.
Hence, it can be concluded that recognizing the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban would be harmful to mankind and would lead to accepting their rules and regulations. Therefore, there should be no place in the world for such a government.",False
46,0,Shreya verma ,"I am for the motion. Feminism means encouraging everyone in your life to split all unpaid work 50/50 between men and women so that they can both thrive, rest, work and feel empowered. And cooking is a profession too. Both men and women can be chef. Infact, there are many jobs related to gardening too which involves a lot of physical activity which both men and women do. So the mindset that physical activity is made only for men should be wiped off. Feminist is equality of sexes, everyone is free to do whatever he/she wants to.

46,0,Shivam Kumar sahu,"There is a common thinking of people that domestic activities particularly  are traditionally associated with women are not as important or valuable as work outside the home. This can lead to decline in the work that women do in the home and can also contribute to a lack of respect for the skills and knowledge that are required to perform these tasks Feminists have argued that domestic activities should be actively reclaimed as empowering because they are important and valuable in their own right and because they allow women to contribute to the well of their families. Many people also argue that reclaiming domestic activities as empowering can help to challenge and transform traditional gender roles. 

This does not mean that feminists believe that all women should be required to engage in domestic activities or that these activities should be the sole focus of womens lives. Rather it means that domestic activities should be  valued as meaningful work and that individuals should have the freedom to choose whether or not to engage in these activities.There is a movement among feminists to reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking, as empowering and important. This is because these activities have historically been seen as the domain of women and therefore not valued as highly as more masculine pursuits. By actively participating in and valuing these activities, feminists aim to challenge the notion that they are lesser or less important, and to reclaim them as meaningful and empowering.

In general recognition of a government by the United Nations requires that the government in question is able to effectively control the territory it claims and is able to provide for the basic needs and rights of its citizens. The United Nations also considers whether a government is committed to upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter, including respect for human right, democracy and the rule of law.

It is important to note that the Talibans annexation of Afghanistan and its establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Taliban are not recognized by the international community and the United Nations continues to recognize the government of Afghanistan as the legitimate government of the country.

5,1,Deepti Saini ,"Feminism has been in controversy since First Wave Feminism. One of the major arguments against it is the defiance of domestic activities as empowering enough by various feminists all over the world. This defiance, however, stands against the fundamental principals of feminism, which is choice. Women who choose conventional gender roles over joining the workforce, often face discrimination from their contemporaries for being primitive or not being ambitious enough. However, the question is, Who decides what is empowering and what is not? As long as an individual finds cooking empowering, more power to them. As far as cooking at home or cooking for the family is concerned, it should be entirely the individual's choice instead of someone else dictating them. Although in most families it is most of the time women who take up these domestic jobs, the problem can be solved by raising awareness about the role of an individual as a family member and how the division of labor within the family members ensure equitable distribution of work within the family.
Secondly, not considering domestic activities as empowering refuses dignity of labor to the people who work as house helps/small-scale laborers as their work is simply labeled as non-ambitious or restricting, or even enslaving. 
One more dimension to the empowerment debate is the economic aspect of the job. If some individual is paid well enough for cooking, does the job still remain non-empowering?
Also, Personal dimensions include women’s participatory role in making household decisions. This helps to enhance self-determination, self-esteem, and autonomy within households and results in their well-being as well as that of their children.
However, the debate does not end here, in fact, talking about women's empowerment is what enables us to make society a more accepting place for both women as well as men.","In my opinion, the UN must not recognize the Islamic Emirate of Taliban till it ensures fundamental human rights to all it citizens for a considerable amount of time, for a decade for instance. Since, the Taliban have continuously been accused for human rights violation, recognition must be on the condition of ensuring safety to women and children, education to females and most importantly completely abolishing the discrimination against women the Taliban remains infamous for. If the world, including the UN provides unconditional recognition to Taliban then other extremists groups or even dictatorial regimes would be eligible for recognition as they are indifferent. 

Talk of “recognition” often concerns factors other than effectiveness, such as political legitimacy, constitutionality, human rights performance, or willingness to establish diplomatic relations.

Indeed most of the discussion about recognizing the Taliban concerns such matters. Many states have linked recognition to the formation of an inclusive and representative government, respect for human and women’s rights, and a commitment to counter-terrorism – but do not appear to doubt the Taliban’s effectiveness. At the Moscow Format Consultations in October 2021, nine states acknowledged that “practical engagement with Afghanistan needed to take into account the new reality, that is the Taliban coming to power in the country, irrespective of the official recognition of the new Afghan government by the international community”

Withholding recognition can be leverage to induce behavioural change – whether on democracy, human rights, or counter-terrorism – assuming that other states can offer things that the entity needs or wants strongly enough. At the same time, humanitarian and medical assistance to the vulnerable Afghan population must not be made hostage to political conditionalities of this kind, which would only serve to punish innocent people.


On the prevailing basis that recognition is a political discretion and not legally constitutive, recognition of the Taliban, and consequential economic and other benefits, should be universally conditioned on it meeting benchmarks of counter-terrorism progress, alongside other international policy goals (such as inclusive governance and respect for human rights). Such conditionality must not, however, come at the expense of humanitarian and medical assistance to a highly vulnerable Afghan population in the midst of an economic crisis.",False
5,1,Gauri Bhardwaj ,"""Feminism isn't about making women stronger. Women are already strong. It's about changing the way the world perceives strength .""Terms like feminism, women empowerment and gender equality should find their roots equally in working in corporate sector and cooking a meal for one's family , therefore I would like to present my views in favour of the motion ""Feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering"".

The birth of the idea of feminism was a result of constant oppression (physical, mental and emotional) women had to face in a male dominated society where men were responsible for taking care of financial needs of the family and women were simply treated as machines to do household chores and their efforts remained unappreciated , the point to be understood here is that feminism is not against the idea of doing household chores rather it focuses on giving equally opportunity to all irrespective of their sex to choose their own profession and work environment , it has to be left on the choice of an individual if he/she  wants to be a homemaker , make money at home or step out to do the same , as members of society we must not judge a person as per one's choice of profession .

People who proclaim themselves as feminists must understand that gender discrimination began only when certain tasks were associated with a particular religion . Their view that women must not be engaged with household chores as it bounds rather than empowering them clearly shows that their thoughts are not different than those with conservative mindsets who associated tasks with genders . The flag holders of feminism need to rethink on the fact that if they want men to take up domestic activities along with their profession then women should also carry both the responsibilities on their shoulders equally .

Another misfortune that comes up with not taking domestic duties as empowerment is that women working in professional fields look down on the upon engaged in domestic activities instead of treating them with dignity . This inferiority can get instilled in the minds of homemaker women and make them question their worth or loose their self confidence .

If people who fight for the rights of women in a patriarchal society look down upon the work of around half the female population how can the one's who do not feel the need of gender equality in society ever believe that giving domestic services is as competent as any other profession .Until domestic activities are not given much importance , their doers not appreciated for their efforts  and household chores are not considered as empowerment real gender equality will always be afar.

","""Terrorism is the tactic of demanding the impossible , and demanding it at gunpoint."", this is exactly what the Taliban organization did when the it annexed Afganistan through the use of
brutality , man power and gun power , therefore the Islamic Emirate of Taliban should not be recognized UN at any cost .

Imagine a situation that due to some ongoing argument among your family members , financial crisis , lack of proper arrangement of furniture in your as per your neighbour's  choice and they suddenly enter your home and demand its possession and you are forced to surrender your home under the threat of your life. What a horrible deed and what a pathetic reason to justify it . Surely none would approve or appreciate your neighbours for their behaviour . Now apply the same situation on a larger level , that's exactly what happened in Afghanistan .

A once liberal , growing and peaceful nation is now crippled to being a financially unstable, religiously intolerant and unsafe space which under no circumstances must be validated by an international organization like the UNO.

UN's recognition of Talibani government would promote other religious groups to undertake activities like explosion of the Bamiyan statues .

When the UNO runs various programs to empower women and advocates women's rights at the same time young girls are being deprived of basic rights like education in Afghanistan.

If Islamic Emirate of Taliban is recognized many other like Tehreek e taliban will also be in the queue for validation and for the maintenance of world peace and order this is definitely the last thing the UNO must do.

The Taliban might appear to be mighty from outside but surely there are internal conflicts . A nation where already half of the population is in rags should at no cost be handed over to an organization which has no economic motifs and faces lack of leadership .

Therefore for the international peace , safety and well being of the residents of Afghanistan the UNO should condemn the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan .

The several unpopular opinions revolving around a topic makes it even more tangled and complex to comprehend precisely. We explore the foundations of women's powerlessness in the domestic sphere ,suggesting that women can move from powerlessness to empowerment by reclaiming the stories of their lives. We argue that this enlarged understanding of empowerment leads us to think of rethink the core liberal concepts of autonomy and responsibility and to examine the relationship between family processes and empowerment in the liberal society. The two gender based assumptions that a woman is supposed to engage in all sorts of domestic activities and fulfilling home responsibilities makes a woman smaller in societies are both wrong in one way or the other. Involvement in domestic activities like gardening,cooking,washing kitchenwares,sweeping,mopping,dusting,childcare and endless household chores can never make a person inferior lest these are perceived as burdensome by the person itself.Primitive thinking takes away our basic ideologies regarding feminism in the wrong direction and we never see anything on the bigger picture.Moreover,the awareness of precise information and knowledge about a matter over an extended period of time has the potential to create a sea change in gendered norms-at home and at work indeed.",-,False
5,1,Ishaan Gupta ,"I would like to present my views in support of the ideology ‘feminism should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowering.’ 
I strongly believe that “There is no limit to what women can accomplish”. As we know that we live in a male chauvinistic society where women are left alone to bear the brunt of social injustice and gender conflicts. Embodying female energy towards men dominated work will help to break multiple prejudice and free them from the chains of servility and ordeals. As we know that women's employment share in urban sectors remain 35% in 2022. Studies further reveal that the quality of women’s labor is poor. The work participation rate (WPR) of women of India is showing a downward trend in the last few decades. Women currently hold only 26.7% of tech-related jobs.
There is vast sea of opportunities for women in domestic activities such as gardening, crafting, cooking etc. These act as a source of employment for women who are occupied in households and don’t get enough time. Women incompetent in other fields can thrive in these activities. Women in this way can assist their families financially as well as socially. This can be fruitful for the growth of the country’s economy as the tertiary sector will witness a spike. Employment of women is considered as a measure of women’s economic empowerment and is also an important indicator of women’s contribution to economic development. This subsequently would lead to males being able to see themselves in typically feminine roles and accept the idea that women can, too, participate efficiently in male dominated sectors of the world.
","On examining the timeline of the annexation of the government of Afghanistan by the Taliban, it is evident that the United Nations has adequate reasons and evidence to deny the acceptance of the Islamic Emirate of the Taliban. 
The organization launched an aggressive onslaught as the US began to withdraw its remaining soldiers from Afghanistan following the 2020 Taliban peace treaty. Despite their promises to respect the rights of women and minority communities and grant amnesty to anyone who helped the United States in its efforts, the Taliban imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law and simultaneously struggle to give Afghans security, food, and economic opportunities.  
Several news outlets have shut down as a result of the Taliban's coercion and restrictions on journalists and press freedoms. The Taliban also reestablished their Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which under previous Taliban rule enforced prohibitions on behavior deemed un-Islamic. In the Education sector, In September 2021, the government ordered primary schools to reopen for both sexes but In March 2022, the Taliban abruptly reversed plans to allow girls to resume primary school education. Since regaining control, the Taliban have taken actions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the late 1990s. 
 Numerous infringements of human rights have been recorded by the UN mission in Afghanistan. A survey in 2019 showed that only 13.4% Afghans showed sympathy for Taliban’s and others said that women rights, freedom of speech and the constitution is important. Many countries are not in favor of establishing ties with the emirates of Taliban and according to me even UN should not recognize it as the emirates of Taliban. Taliban should be blacklisted, any country or organization that tries to establish relations with Taliban should be blacklisted.

5,1,Shivya Gupta,"Being a feminist not just means putting forth your argument that women should be working at positions equivalent to men in corporates, government or labs; it also means acknowledging the efforts put by women to do basic everyday household chores. Often, we fail to understand the amount of efforts to go behind planting a sapling, more so because many of us haven't even done gardening ever in our lives. Still, we are quick to pass our judgement, saying it is an easy task. Let me ask another question, even if we have sowed seeds to planted a sapling, how many of us have been able to successfully nurture a plant, making sure it gets enough sunlight and adequately watering it. I wouldn't be wrong in saying only a few of us. So, collectively as a society, we don't recognise the efforts of women who do so. They are no less than scientists in a lab, experimenting with the amount of water and sunlight to find the perfect combination for each plant. If the feminists only won't understand the significance of activities such as gardening or cooking, who else would? It can be said that although these activities might not have any monetary benefits in the start, if the women actively participate in such activities and hone their skills, they can gain expertise and soon start their own businesses in their preferred lines, which would empower them. Even if they just do it as an obligation or as a hobby, their efforts and energy still count, and these domestic activities carried out by them should be duly appreciated.

These conflicts force the people to move out of their countries in the hope of a better life, but little do they know that their lives are going to be much worse. A similar case happened with Mexicans, as the numbers of the Mexican immigrants surged in the adjoining US border. These immigrants came illegally, and the trouble was further expedited as they started pursuing illegal activities which adversely affected both the countries, as well as the foreign relations between them. The illegal Mexican immigrants started smuggling drugs in the USA, which posed a major problem. Moreover, these immigrants are responsible for the drain of the US economy. They come as workers, and start working for even low wages as they already face food shortages. As they accept low wages, the other American workers get distressed because of this.

5,1,Apoorva Kumari,"Yes, I think feminists should actively reclaim domestic activities as empowerment. Domestic work like cooking, cleaning, and gardening has always been looked down upon as something which is inferior and only done by people who are not independent or self-sufficient. A large section of women in India and across the globe are engaged in different forms of domestic activities and hence it becomes even more important that domestic work gets recognized as something which is empowering.
Homemakers and housewives who constitute a large fraction of our population are made to look at their duties and situations as a homemaker as it is something that was holding them back from ‘real power’ by the modern feminists. However, I think those feminists are wrong. Women already have power. They have the power to provide for their families, take care of them by nurturing them with real home-cooked foods, and heal them when they became ill. They are producers rather than just mindless consumers. They work with their partners to create good lives and healthy families and their contributions are every bit as valuable as men’s.
I think as long as domestic work and homemaking do not get recognized as something which is empowering, it is impossible for us to achieve equality of all sexes which is the basic idea of feminism. We need to start recognizing and encouraging domesticity because it is smart and empowering. Domestic work is a powerful life choice that makes one more self-sufficient and in control of their finances and future.
And hence, I think it is very important for modern feminists to reclaim and recognize domestic work as something which is empowering and as valuable as going out and earning.","There is a real crisis at the border right now.

People are coming for several reasons like violence, insecurity,poverty, lack of economic opportunity, etc. A few solutions to this problem could probably be having more courts and judges in a reformed asylum system, expand access to legal counsel, getting serious about alternatives to detention, especially family case management, revamping the ports of entry, etc. I think we should  recognize Mexico’s efforts to support Central American migrants and expand access to asylum. Both countries should also work together and with the UNHCR to ensure that a procedure is in place to support Central Americans at risk who deem that the United States is the most appropriate place for them to request asylum, either due to family ties, concerns about safety in Mexico, or other reasons.

It is true that in some areas and on certain issues, there have been improvements: for example, in Saudi Arabia women were allowed, for the first time, to vote and run for office in 2015.

Although that might be true to a certain extent, we have seen that as time and generations have passed, humans have evolved themselves and the environment around them in a way that these natural differences do not act as a barrier in our modern world. With changing times people have started to develop a sense of equality in jobs and work irrespective of gender. This being said, I am against the motion that feminists should reclaim domestic work as 'empowering'. 

My reason behind this stance lies in belief that the future generations should understand the concept of equality of honor that lies in every job, task and work in the world, again irrespective of gender.

I should point out the fact that I support the that act of feminists, be that feminist be a man or woman, actively reclaiming domestic household work but not it as 'EMPOWERING' but rather it as essential; necessary for a household to function properly. There is a need of understanding that there is a need of inculcating the in minds of young ones that all kinds of domestic works hold importance and honor per se, and the person doing it should be given honor equal to that of the breadwinner of the family. If feminists are 'RECLAIMING' these household work, that must mean that they must have consciously left these household works thinking them of as degrading at some point in their lives. In my opinion, household domestic works should not be categorized as empowering or degrading in any capacity if you are actively working towards the concept of equality in the first place.

One cannot deny the fact that the government of Afghanistan was overthrown by an entity under the pressure or firearms and violence.

Tha basic principles of Taliban violate all kinds of human rights you can imagine. From forcibly making women wear a burqa, control all kinds of the news that comes and goes out of the country, the treatment of women and children, the killings and massacre. Women have been stopped from going to schools and universities, ordered not to leave their homes without a male guardian. Children, or boys I should say, are being taught nothing but the translation of Quran in the schools. The situation in hospitals is such that 2 to 3 patients are lying on the same bed for treatment and doctors are compelled to save a life on random basis. The country is left without a constitution; nothing but Sharia law in their so called ""courts"". The economic situation in Afghanistan worsens day by day under this this terrorist regime. The UN has said that nearly half the country is in a state of acute hunger with more than 90% of its people below the poverty line. In the name of extremist nationalism, Taliban has been spreading terrorism and governing a country that they are not able to manage and should not manage.

5,1,ananya,"Reclaiming domestic activities as empowering may be well-intentioned, but it ultimately reinforces the problematic idea that domestic work is inherently feminized and therefore the responsibility of women. This places a disproportionate burden on women, who may already struggle with the expectations placed on them to perform domestic labor in addition to paid work.

Furthermore, this motion suggests that domestic work is somehow lesser or less important than other forms of work, which is not only untrue but also belittling to those who may choose to pursue domestic work as a career. Domestic work, whether performed by men or women, should be valued and respected as any other profession.

Instead of focusing on reclaiming domestic activities as empowering for feminists, we should be working towards creating a society in which domestic work is fairly distributed and valued regardless of gender. This could include initiatives such as the implementation of paid parental leave, universal childcare, and fair wages for domestic workers.

In conclusion, while the intention behind reclaiming domestic activities as empowering may be noble, it ultimately reinforces harmful gender roles and fails to address the root issue of unequal distribution and devaluation of domestic labor. Instead, we should be striving for a society in which all forms of work, including domestic work, are fairly distributed and valued.","The plight of immigrants at the US-Mexico border is a deeply concerning and complex issue. Many individuals, driven by poverty and the pursuit of a better life, take great risks to cross the border illegally in search of opportunity. Unfortunately, this often leads to their involvement in illegal activities, such as drug smuggling and human trafficking, as they seek to pay for their passage or survive in a foreign and hostile environment.

The rise in illegal activities at the border has had significant consequences for both the US and Mexico. In the US, crime rates have increased as a result of illegal border crossings and the associated criminal activity. Additionally, the influx of immigrants has put a strain on resources and negatively impacted the quality of life for both immigrants and citizens.

Mexico also suffers as a result of the situation at the border. Many immigrants face abuse and mistreatment at the hands of smugglers and traffickers, and the country's efforts to combat these crimes have led to an increase in violence and corruption.

To address this problem, it is essential to develop fair and effective policies that address the root causes of illegal immigration. This could include addressing economic inequality and political instability in countries of origin, as well as creating a legal pathway for immigration and increasing assistance for refugees.

The situation at the US-Mexico border is a complex and multifaceted issue, but it is also an opportunity for growth and progress. 
Each year, thousands of immigrants make the brave and difficult journey across the border in search of a better life. While the journey can be treacherous and many face challenges, their determination and resilience is truly inspiring.

Feminists should not feel the need to reclaim domestic activities such as gardening and cooking as empowering because these activities should not be viewed as inherently feminist or non-feminist. It is important to recognize that individuals, regardless of their gender, should be free to pursue any activity or interest that brings them joy and fulfillment, without it being tied to their gender or political beliefs. Furthermore, focusing on domestic activities as a form of feminist empowerment may reinforce the idea that these activities are the primary domain of women, and may perpetuate traditional gender roles rather than challenging them.
